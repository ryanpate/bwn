Alright, folks, gather around because we need to talk about something that’s been brewing in the crypto world. You know those bots that flood your feed with nonsense? Well, apparently, X (formerly known as Twitter) has been playing favorites, and it’s not good news for real users like us.

So here’s the tea: Ki Young Ju, the founder of CryptoQuant, took to X to unleash some serious criticism on the platform for its apparent double standards. Instead of tackling the bot infestation, X is punishing legit crypto accounts. Seriously, how does that make sense?

Ju pointed out that there’s been a crazy uptick in automated posts, with over 7.7 million crypto-related tweets in just one day. That’s a whopping increase of 1,200% compared to before! Imagine trying to scroll through your feed, only to be bombarded with spammy posts that make you question your life choices. It's like being stuck in a never-ending TikTok loop of cringe-worthy dance challenges, but for crypto.

Here’s the kicker: Ju claims that X's algorithm is clamping down on real accounts because it can't differentiate between humans and bots. He bluntly stated that it’s absurd for X to ban genuine crypto content while letting bots “pay to spam.” I mean, can we talk about priorities here?

But wait, it gets crazier. Nikita Bier, X’s head of product, stepped up to the plate and said that the decline in visibility for Crypto Twitter isn’t just the algorithm’s fault — it’s also because users are going wild with posting. Apparently, some accounts are so eager to engage that they’re flooding their followers with low-value messages (like a million 'gm' replies). Bier went as far as saying, “CT is dying from suicide, not from the algorithm.” Ouch! 

This has sparked a heated debate across the crypto community. One user pointed out that by suppressing Crypto Twitter content, X is ignoring a niche that keeps the platform alive. And honestly, it’s hard to disagree. Crypto enthusiasts rely on X as their go-to hub for real-time updates, insights, and on-chain analysis. So why would X want to undermine its own lifeline? 

Now, let’s take a moment to vibe check this whole situation. The mood in the crypto world is a mix of frustration and disbelief. Users are feeling like they’re stuck in a bad relationship where their needs are ignored. You know, like when your favorite show gets canceled after a cliffhanger ending (looking at you, Netflix).

But here’s the million-dollar question: will X actually step up and fix its bot problem, or are we all just going to be stuck sifting through spam for the foreseeable future? As we navigate this chaotic landscape, one thing is for sure — we’ll be keeping our eyes open for any updates, and you should too. Because in this wild world of crypto, you never know what’s coming next.

So, what do you think? Is it time for X to get its act together and start listening to its users? Or are we destined to be drowned in bot spam forever? Let’s keep the conversation going!
