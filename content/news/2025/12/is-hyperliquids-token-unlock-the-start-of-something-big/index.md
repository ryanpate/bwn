Alright, fam, let’s talk about Hyperliquid. You might be wondering, ‘What’s Hyperliquid and why should I care?’ Well, if you’re into crypto (or even just mildly curious), you’ll want to tune in. This weekend, Hyperliquid kicked off their team token unlock, and let me tell you, the vibes are all over the place.

So, here’s the scoop: Hyperliquid’s team unlocked about 1.75 million $HYPE tokens, which is around $60 million in value. Yeah, that’s a hefty chunk of change! But here’s where it gets a little murky: different team members have different vesting schedules. So, while some are cashing in, others are keeping their tokens close to their chests. 

What’s even more interesting is how those unlocked tokens are being handled. An on-chain analyst (with a name as cool as Kirby) noted that out of the 1.75 million tokens, only about 609,000 $HYPE (that’s 23.4% for those who like numbers) went to an OTC desk named Flowdesk, presumably to sell. The rest? A good chunk is being re-staked, and some are just chilling in wallets, untouched. It’s like that pizza you ordered that you just can’t bring yourself to eat—it’s there, but you’re not ready to dive in.

Now, let’s break it down a bit more. You might be scratching your head about why there’s confusion over future unlocks. Well, according to Steven from Yunt Capital, if the pace of unlocks continues as it has, we might be waiting almost a century for the full allocation of 238 million $HYPE tokens reserved for the team. Like, excuse me? 

But wait, it gets better (or worse, depending on how you look at it). The original timeline promised a 24-48 month schedule for these unlocks. So, unless Hyperliquid speeds things up, we might be in for a long, loooong wait. It’s almost like waiting for the next season of your favorite Netflix show—where’s the closure, people?

Here’s the thing: this whole situation isn’t just a crypto drama for the Twitter crowd. It matters to us regular folks too. If these tokens flood into the market at a snail’s pace, it could affect the overall health and price of $HYPE. We want to see this project thrive, right? 

Now, let’s talk market vibes. Crypto Twitter is buzzing. Some are panicking (as usual) about how this unlock could affect prices, while others are cautiously optimistic, hoping the team can manage the token supply without crashing the party. It’s like watching a reality show: will they or won’t they make it work? 

In the end, it looks like Hyperliquid is trying to balance contributor fairness with keeping their token value stable. It’s a tough act to pull off, and we’re all watching closely. So, what’s the takeaway here? 

As we dive deeper into 2023, keep an eye on how this token unlock shakes out. Will Hyperliquid find its rhythm, or are we in for a wild ride? Whatever happens, you can bet we’ll be here for the drama. 

So, are you Team Hyperliquid, or do you think it’s time to take your $HYPE and run? Let me know your thoughts!
