Alright, fam, let’s talk about something that’s been lurking in the shadows of crypto—yearly candles. Sounds boring, right? But stick with me because this might just be the crystal ball you didn’t know you needed for 2026!

Here's the thing: if you’ve been in crypto for a while, you probably remember the wild rides of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). Those yearly candles? They’re like the mood rings of the crypto world, showing us how things have been going from year to year. Spoiler alert: it’s been a rocky road, and 2026 might not be a walk in the park either.

Now, let’s zoom out. When you check out BTC’s yearly log chart, it’s like watching a superhero movie where the hero just keeps rising—straight up and to the right. But ETH? Well, it’s more like that one friend who can’t decide if they want to be serious or silly—lots of ups and downs, and it looks a bit more chaotic.

But here’s where it gets interesting. Those red candles in the charts? They represent some of the darkest days in crypto history. Think back to 2014’s Mt. Gox crisis (yikes), the 2018 aftermath of ICO mania (double yikes), and of course, the 2022 collapse that took down names like Luna, 3AC, and FTX (triple yikes). If we take a close look, we’re about to close out some of the most modest yearly red candles in BTC and ETH’s history. Like, can we get a collective sigh of relief?

So what does this all mean for us regular folks? Well, there are two ways to look at it. One, we might not be out of the woods yet, and 2026 could bring more red candles (cue the dramatic music). Or two, maybe the industry is maturing, and we won’t see any major catastrophes to ruin the vibe. It’s kind of like waiting for a storm that never quite hits, leaving you with a bit of anxiety but also a hint of hope. 

Market sentiment right now is a mixed bag. People are tired (and who wouldn’t be after a year of red?). There’s a sense of fatigue spreading through the crypto community. You can almost hear the whispers of ‘Is this it? Are we done for?’ But let’s not forget, we’ve been here before. And as the saying goes, what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger (and maybe a little more cynical).

But wait, it gets better! Even if 2026 starts off on a low note, it doesn’t mean it’s game over. Sometimes, things need to get a bit messy before they can clean up. Think of it as a necessary detox before a big party. So if we brace ourselves for a marginally red year, but somehow things take a turn for the better, we’ll be ready to ride the wave when the good times roll back in.

As for the future? Keep your eyes peeled for opportunities. Yes, it’s as weird as it sounds, but crypto is all about survival. You want to be around when things start popping off again, not left wondering what could have been. 

So let’s keep the convo going: How are you feeling about your crypto journey? Are you ready for another year of uncertainty, or are you secretly hoping for a surprise turnaround? Let’s chat in the comments below!
