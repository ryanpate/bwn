GM, crypto fam! So, how’s that crypto portfolio treating you today? If you’re feeling a bit queasy watching Bitcoin nosedive to a four-month low of $105,700, you’re definitely not alone. It seems like every day brings us a fresh dose of market madness, and this week has been no exception.

Here’s the thing: just when you thought you could trust the crypto markets to behave, JPMorgan swoops in to say that the chaos was largely self-inflicted by, you guessed it, crypto natives. Yep, that’s right. In a world where we’re all trying to keep our heads above water, it turns out the sellers in the room are indeed the ones causing the ruckus.

💔 **The Background**  
Let’s rewind a bit. Bitcoin has been riding a rollercoaster lately, but this latest drop has sent shockwaves through the community. According to JPMorgan’s notes to clients, the sell pressure we saw last week was not the work of institutional investors like the big shots we often hear about. Nope, it was primarily from those of us who live and breathe crypto—the so-called crypto natives. 

This selloff was epic, with more than $19 billion in liquidations hitting the market last Friday. That’s like watching your favorite show get canceled after a cliffhanger. Not cool! And while the crypto market was experiencing this epic meltdown, traditional finance (TradFi) seemed to be sitting pretty. CME’s institutional contracts barely budged while the retail market was in shambles. Talk about a tale of two worlds!

📉 **What Went Down**  
The numbers are wild. Glassnode reported that nearly $12 billion in futures open interest just poofed overnight, marking the largest single-day decline ever recorded. Yikes! But hold on—while retail investors were scrambling, institutional investments remained steady. In fact, Bitcoin ETFs saw inflows of $2.4 billion over the last two weeks despite the chaos. It’s almost like they’re playing a different game entirely.

👀 **Why Should You Care?**  
Now, you might be asking yourself: “Why does all this drama matter to me?” Well, here’s the scoop. While the crypto natives were busy dumping their coins, institutional investors—those who usually have a longer investment horizon—kept on buying. So, who exactly was selling? Turns out, it was the ancient whales and those who still believe in the infamous four-year cycle. These whales have been around since the dawn of crypto, and they’ve sold off a huge chunk of their holdings this year. 

But don’t lose hope just yet! There are some silver linings here. First, these ancient whales won’t be able to sell forever. Sooner or later, they’ll run out of Bitcoin to offload. Secondly, that four-year cycle won’t last indefinitely. And lastly, institutional money is still flowing into the market. It’s almost like they’re waiting for the right moment to pounce, and that could set us up for a solid rebound.

😅 **Market Vibes Check**  
So, what’s the mood on crypto Twitter? Well, it’s a bit of a mixed bag. Some folks are throwing their hands up in despair, while others are holding on to the hope that this is just a temporary setback. Memes are flying around like confetti—some celebrating the chaos, others lamenting their losses. It’s a classic case of another day in crypto, where the highs are high and the lows are... well, a little too low.

🌈 **The Bottom Line**  
As we ride this wave of uncertainty, let’s keep one thing in mind: this too shall pass. With institutions still keen to invest and a potential gold-to-Bitcoin rally on the horizon, there’s reason to be cautiously optimistic. Plus, if you’re still holding on, you might just find that this downturn sets the stage for new all-time highs in the not-so-distant future.

So, here’s a thought to chew on: In a world where the crypto market swings from extreme euphoria to sheer panic, how do you stay sane? Let’s discuss—drop your thoughts in the comments!
