Let's be real for a sec: if you’ve been keeping an eye on Bitcoin lately, you probably feel like you’re on a rollercoaster that’s stuck upside down. Just when we thought we were heading towards a sweet ride over $115,500, the market decided to hit the brakes. Yeah, it was a disappointing ride last week. Bitcoin peaked, then plummeted, leaving many of us wondering if we should be holding our breath or our wallets.

So, what happened? Well, on Monday, Bitcoin showed some promise, climbing up into resistance. But by Thursday, it had retraced all those gains, closing the week at a somewhat underwhelming $110,591. Not the worst, but certainly not the kind of number that sends bulls running for the champagne. And let’s not forget the Federal Reserve’s latest moves. They cut interest rates by 25 basis points, but Chairman Powell basically said, "Don’t get your hopes up for more in December." Talk about a mood killer!

Now, here’s where it gets spicy. The key support level everyone’s watching is $106,900. Think of it like a safety net for the bulls. It held up last week, but if it gets tested again, things could get dicey. If Bitcoin falls below that level, we might be looking at a potential drop to $100,000. And if that sounds like doomsday, it might just be. We do have a little buffer at $104,000, but let’s be honest—it's already taken a couple of hits and might not hold up much longer.

And as they say, the more you hit support, the weaker it gets. So, if you’re a bull, now’s the time to start praying for a miracle. Maybe we need a meme to rally the troops? 😅 

Looking ahead, the market is feeling a bit bearish. Many are wondering if Bitcoin can regain its mojo this week. The daily chart isn't looking too hot, and unless buyers step up in a big way, we might be in for a rough ride. The next few days will be crucial, especially with the Consumer Price Index report dropping on November 13. If inflation numbers show improvement, we could see the market react positively, which might give the bulls a fighting chance.

But wait, it gets better (or worse, depending on how you see it)! If the Nasdaq continues to trend lower, Bitcoin might just take a backseat. So, for all you crypto enthusiasts out there, keep your eyes peeled. The bulls are going to need some serious support from the broader market, or else we might just see more 'bear' drama unfold.

In conclusion, the crypto market is full of ups and downs—one day you're on top of the world, and the next, you’re wondering if you should panic sell or HODL through the storm. So, what's your game plan? Are you still holding strong, or is it time to hit the eject button? One thing's for sure: whether you're a believer or just in it for the memes, it's never a dull moment in the world of Bitcoin. 

Stay tuned, stay savvy, and remember: in crypto, anything can happen. And often does! 😎
