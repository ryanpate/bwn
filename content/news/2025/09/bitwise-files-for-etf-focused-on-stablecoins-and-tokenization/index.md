Bitwise Asset Management has initiated the process to launch a new exchange-traded fund (ETF) focused on stablecoins and asset tokenization, with a target launch date around Thanksgiving 2023. The filing, submitted on September 16, outlines a fund designed to track the Bitwise Stablecoin and Tokenization Index, which will include companies and assets that are expected to benefit from the growing adoption of stablecoins and the tokenization of real-world assets.

The proposed ETF is structured as a 40 Act fund, which typically allows for a faster regulatory review process compared to other types of fund filings. This could enable Bitwise to bring the ETF to market within months, rather than the years that can sometimes be required for other fund structures. Eric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, noted that the 40 Act filings often face shorter approval periods, making a swift launch plausible.

The fund is designed to have two equally weighted sleeves: one focused on equities and the other on crypto assets. The equity sleeve will invest up to 50% in companies categorized into five sectors: stablecoin issuers, infrastructure providers, payment processors, tokenization exchanges, and retailers that are oriented towards stablecoins. To ensure a diversified portfolio, companies will face tiered weight restrictions based on their level of exposure to the stablecoin market. Tier 1 firms with significant stablecoin business will have a cap of 15%, Tier 2 companies with material exposure will face an 8% limit, and Tier 3 entities with limited involvement will be restricted to 3%.

The ETF plans to select 20 companies from the top two tiers and may include up to 10 Tier 3 companies if necessary. The crypto asset sleeve will invest in exchange-traded products that provide exposure to blockchain infrastructure, with the requirement that these assets represent at least 1% market share in stablecoins or tokenization. Furthermore, the fund will allocate 5% for oracle tokens, which are essential for connecting blockchains to external systems, with the largest constituent capped at 22.5% of the index. The fund will undergo quarterly rebalancing and will primarily concentrate on information technology companies.

As of the filing date, Bitwise manages approximately $15 billion in crypto assets across 30 investment products, which include spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. The filing for this new ETF aligns with a broader trend among companies aiming to capture the growing institutional interest in the tokenization of real-world assets. The market for stablecoins has seen significant growth, recently reaching a total supply of $287 billion, indicating a robust interest and potential for further expansion in this segment of the cryptocurrency market.

The proposed ETF reflects the increasing demand for investment vehicles that allow exposure to the evolving landscape of digital assets, particularly in the realm of stablecoins and tokenization. As more institutional investors seek to participate in this space, the approval and launch of such funds could play a crucial role in shaping the future of cryptocurrency investments.

In summary, Bitwise's filing for a stablecoin and tokenization ETF represents a significant step in the evolution of crypto investment products, potentially catering to a growing market of institutional investors looking to engage with stablecoins and tokenization strategies.
