Botanix Labs, a Bitcoin Layer Two protocol founded in 2023 at Harvard, has recently launched stBTC, a new Bitcoin-backed asset designed to redistribute network transaction fees as yield to its holders. This innovative offering allows users to stake their Bitcoin and earn additional Bitcoin without the drawbacks of inflationary token emissions or mandatory lockups, marking a significant development in the crypto space.

The Botanix protocol operates similarly to other Bitcoin Layer Two solutions like the Liquid Network and Rootstock, but it incorporates modern scripting tools and a unique revenue-sharing model. The network is supported by a federation of 16 node operators, ensuring a robust custody foundation. Since its mainnet launch two months ago, Botanix has successfully processed over 10 million transactions while maintaining 100% uptime for peg-ins and peg-outs, according to founder Willem Schroé.

One of the critical questions surrounding any yield-bearing product is the source of the yield. Botanix has structured its stBTC token to earn 50% of all transaction fees generated on the Botanix network. This approach is designed to provide a more stable and transparent yield compared to previous models that contributed to the volatility seen in the crypto market, particularly during the 2022 crash involving firms like FTX and Celsius. Currently, stBTC offers a yield of 34% APR, although this high figure is attributed to accumulated undistributed rewards from its prelaunch phase. Schroé anticipates that the APR will stabilize around 5-6% as the network matures.

The stBTC token contract adheres to the EIP-4626 standard and has undergone audits by Spearbit and Sigma Prime, ensuring its security and reliability. Users can deposit Bitcoin into the Botanix federation through the Botanix bridge and receive an equivalent amount of Botanix Layer Two Bitcoin, which can be managed using an EVM-compatible wallet like Metamask. It's worth noting that the Botanix token carries the ticker 'BTC,' which may cause some confusion with other wrapped Bitcoin products like WBTC. However, Botanix BTC can function across the crypto EVM-compatible ecosystem just like other similar assets.

Once users acquire Botanix BTC, they can stake it on the Botanix yield page, converting it into stBTC and starting to earn yield. Additionally, users have the option to purchase stBTC with Bitcoin through the platform bitzy.app/swap. This staking mechanism not only enhances the security of the Botanix network but is also expected to unlock further benefits in the future, including the ability for users to vote on key network decisions.

The introduction of a yield-bearing Bitcoin asset like stBTC is significant, as it reflects a shift towards more traditional financial principles within the crypto space. It allows users to leverage their Bitcoin for loans, similar to how one might use a rental property as collateral for a mortgage. Currently, users can take out USDC loans against their stBTC with interest rates starting as low as 0.6% APR via the Stargate DeFi protocol. This innovative feature enables users to potentially earn yield on their stBTC while simultaneously covering loan payments, provided they understand the dynamics of the loan structure.

The user experience on the Botanix network is designed to be intuitive, featuring crypto-to-crypto swap boxes and familiar terminology such as bridges and yield. However, the platform's interface may feel less polished compared to established DeFi portals like Uniswap, which could pose a learning curve for new users. The decision to use the same ticker for Botanix BTC as the underlying asset may also lead to initial confusion.

Overall, Botanix Labs is making strides in integrating Bitcoin into the decentralized finance ecosystem, potentially paving the way for a more comprehensive range of financial services in the crypto space. As the platform continues to evolve, it may bring Bitcoin closer to functioning as a fully operational digital bank, offering users the financial tools they expect in today's market.

In summary, Botanix Labs' launch of stBTC represents a significant advancement in the crypto landscape, providing users with a new way to earn yield on their Bitcoin while maintaining the asset's integrity.
