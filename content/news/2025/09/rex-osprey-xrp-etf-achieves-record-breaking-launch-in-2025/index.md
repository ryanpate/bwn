The launch of the Rex-Osprey hybrid spot XRP ETF marks a significant milestone in the cryptocurrency investment landscape, reflecting the growing demand for regulated digital asset investment vehicles. Debuting in 2025, this ETF has achieved the strongest launch performance of any US ETF this year, indicating a robust interest from investors in alternative digital assets.

On September 18, 2025, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Eric Balchunas reported that the Rex-Osprey XRP ETF, trading under the ticker XRPR, recorded a remarkable $37.7 million in natural trading volume on its first day. This figure not only sets a record for 2025 but also establishes the ETF as the most actively traded fund on its launch day this year. Notably, within just 90 minutes of its launch, the fund had already crossed $24 million in trades, a figure that is five times the first-hour volume seen by any crypto futures ETF introduced in the same year.

In addition to the XRP ETF, Rex-Osprey also launched a companion Dogecoin ETF, identified by the ticker DOJE, which garnered significant market interest. Balchunas noted that the Dogecoin ETF saw nearly $6 million traded in its first hour and closed the day with a total of $17 million in trading volume, positioning it among the top five ETF debuts of 2025. These strong early numbers highlight a growing investor appetite for regulated exposure to alternative digital assets, suggesting a positive outlook for future ETF offerings.

The structure of the Rex-Osprey ETFs is noteworthy, as these products are registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and are structured through Cayman Islands subsidiaries. This regulatory framework differentiates them from the 1933 Act funds that were used for the spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs that launched in the previous year. This indicates that issuers are exploring various regulatory pathways to introduce altcoins into the ETF market, which may pave the way for more diverse investment options in the future.

Despite the impressive trading volumes, the immediate market reaction for the underlying tokens, XRP and Dogecoin, was less favorable. XRP's price fell by 3% within 24 hours of the ETF's debut, bringing it down to $3.02. This decline extended a week of gradual decreases, with XRP fluctuating between $3 and $3.15. Similarly, Dogecoin experienced a pullback of 2%, settling at $0.2735 after briefly reaching a seven-month high of $0.2879 during the ETF's launch. This discrepancy underscores the difference between the enthusiasm for ETF trading in secondary markets and the direct demand for the cryptocurrencies themselves.

The launch of the Rex-Osprey XRP ETF is significant not only for its record-breaking debut but also for its implications for the future of cryptocurrency investment vehicles. As demand for regulated digital asset products continues to rise, the success of this ETF may encourage further innovation and exploration of regulatory frameworks within the crypto space. Investors and market participants will be closely watching how these developments unfold and their potential impact on the broader cryptocurrency market.

In conclusion, the Rex-Osprey XRP ETF's record-breaking launch in 2025 highlights a growing trend towards regulated digital asset investment, while also illustrating the complexities of market dynamics between ETF enthusiasm and direct cryptocurrency demand.
