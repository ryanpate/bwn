The Warsaw Stock Exchange (GPW) has made a significant move by officially listing the Bitcoin BETA ETF, marking a milestone for investors in Poland. This new offering allows Polish investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin through a regulated exchange-traded fund (ETF), broadening the options available in the local financial market.

The Bitcoin BETA ETF is managed by AgioFunds TFI SA and is designed to provide exposure to Bitcoin through futures contracts that are listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). A notable feature of this ETF is its incorporation of a foreign exchange (FX) risk hedging strategy, which aims to mitigate the impact of fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the Polish zloty. This makes it the first ETF on GPW to offer cryptocurrency exposure while simultaneously managing currency volatility, a critical aspect for local investors.

Michał Kobza, a Member of the Management Board of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, emphasized the importance of this launch, stating that GPW is responding to investors' expectations and the growing trend of diversifying asset classes available on public markets. He highlighted that the Bitcoin BETA ETF enhances the safety of trading, allowing investors to participate in the cryptocurrency market through an instrument that is supervised, cleared, and adheres to transparency standards applicable to a regulated capital market.

The ETF's prospectus received approval from the Polish Financial Supervision Authority (KNF) on June 17, 2025, which authorized AgioFunds TFI to issue both Series A and B investment certificates. To ensure sufficient liquidity for the ETF, Dom Maklerski Banku Ochrony Środowiska S.A. has been appointed as the market maker. Kazimierz Szpak, CEO of BETA TFI SA and BETA ETF Asset Manager at AgioFunds TFI SA, noted that the introduction of this ETF is a response to the increasing demand from investors for new asset classes. He expressed confidence that the Bitcoin BETA ETF would meet market expectations and be positively received by investors.

With the launch of the Bitcoin BETA ETF, the total number of ETFs listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange has now reached sixteen. This includes various funds that track Polish indices such as WIG20, mWIG40, and sWIG80, as well as international benchmarks like the S&P 500, Nasdaq-100, and DAX. The exchange also offers sector-specific ETFs, leveraged ETFs, and inverse ETFs.

The adoption of ETFs in Poland has been witnessing rapid growth. According to data from GPW, the turnover in ETFs has reached PLN 1.9 billion year-to-date, reflecting a remarkable 94.2% increase compared to the same period last year. By listing its first Bitcoin ETF, GPW aligns itself with global capital markets that have already embraced Bitcoin-based products. This listing signifies a response to the rising demand from both institutional and retail investors who are seeking regulated pathways to access Bitcoin as an asset class. Furthermore, it strengthens Poland's position in the rapidly evolving ETF landscape.

In conclusion, the introduction of the Bitcoin BETA ETF on the Warsaw Stock Exchange represents a significant advancement in the accessibility of cryptocurrency investments for Polish investors, offering a regulated and secure means of participating in the Bitcoin market.
