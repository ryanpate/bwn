### TL;DR
- Warsaw Stock Exchange lists Bitcoin BETA ETF, first of its kind in Poland.
- ETF managed by AgioFunds TFI SA provides exposure to Bitcoin futures.
- Includes a foreign exchange risk hedging strategy for currency fluctuations.
- Approval from Polish Financial Supervision Authority granted on June 17, 2025.

Alright, folks! Big news from the Warsaw Stock Exchange (GPW) â€” they just dropped the Bitcoin BETA ETF, and itâ€™s a game changer for Polish investors. This shiny new ETF means you can finally get a taste of Bitcoin through a legit, regulated fund (because letâ€™s be real, who doesnâ€™t want in on the crypto craze?).

So hereâ€™s the scoop: the Bitcoin BETA ETF is managed by AgioFunds TFI SA and lets you invest in Bitcoin futures, which are like betting on the future price of Bitcoin (without actually owning the Bitcoin itself, if that makes sense). Whatâ€™s even cooler is that this ETF has a foreign exchange (FX) risk hedging strategy built in. That means itâ€™s designed to help cushion the blow from any fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the Polish zloty. Basically, itâ€™s like having a safety net for your investments. How handy is that?

MichaÅ‚ Kobza, whoâ€™s on the Management Board of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, said theyâ€™re really listening to what investors want. Thereâ€™s a growing trend to diversify, and this ETF is just what the doctor ordered. By introducing the Bitcoin BETA ETF, theyâ€™re making it safer to trade crypto, letting you jump into this wild market with a regulated and transparent instrument. No shady business here!

Now, letâ€™s talk timelines. The Polish Financial Supervision Authority (KNF) gave their thumbs up on June 17, 2025, which means AgioFunds TFI can issue Series A and B investment certificates. To keep things running smoothly, Dom Maklerski Banku Ochrony Åšrodowiska S.A. has been brought on board as the market maker. Kazimierz Szpak, the CEO of BETA TFI SA and BETA ETF Asset Manager at AgioFunds TFI SA, mentioned that this launch is all about meeting the growing demand from investors. Heâ€™s pretty confident that the Bitcoin BETA ETF is going to be a hit.

With this new ETF in the mix, the total number of ETFs on the Warsaw Stock Exchange has now hit sixteen. Thatâ€™s right, folks! Weâ€™ve got a variety of funds tracking local indices like WIG20 and mWIG40, as well as international heavyweights like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100. Plus, theyâ€™ve got sector-specific ETFs, leveraged ETFs, and even inverse ETFs. Talk about a buffet of options!

Now, hereâ€™s the kicker: ETFs are booming in Poland! According to GPW, ETF turnover has skyrocketed to PLN 1.9 billion this year, showing a staggering 94.2% increase compared to the same time last year. By rolling out its first Bitcoin ETF, GPW is totally keeping up with the global capital markets that have already embraced Bitcoin products. This is a big deal, especially for institutional and retail investors looking for safe ways to dive into Bitcoin.

In a nutshell, the Bitcoin BETA ETF is a major step in making crypto investments more accessible for Polish investors. It's like giving you a secure and regulated door to the Bitcoin party. Time to get in on the action!
