Arthur Hayes, co-founder of the crypto investment fund Maelstrom, has made significant investments in Ethena, acquiring nearly $1 million worth of its ENA tokens over the past two days. This move aligns with the upcoming vote by Hyperliquid validators regarding the USDH stablecoin ticker, set for Sunday.

Ethena, which is backed by BlackRock, has proposed a strategy that involves using its USDtb stablecoin to collateralize USDH. The proposal includes a commitment to route 95% of revenue to Hyperliquid and to cover the costs associated with shifting trading pairs from USDC. Hayes' recent purchases, tracked by Arkham Intelligence, include 578,956 ENA tokens worth about $473,000 on Wednesday, along with earlier acquisitions totaling roughly 672,800 ENA for approximately $521,000. In total, his investments in Ethena amount to around $995,000 within just 48 hours.

The context of this investment is critical, as Ethena is vying for control of the USDH stablecoin ticker in a competitive landscape. Hyperliquid validators are expected to make their decision on Sunday, and the outcome could significantly influence the future of the USDH stablecoin. According to David Lawant, head of research at FalconX, Ethena's proposal is strong, highlighting the project's rapid growth and its impressive track record, having processed $23 billion in cumulative mints and redemptions without security incidents.

However, some analysts suggest that Hayes' investment may reflect personal positioning rather than a direct endorsement of Ethena for the USDH vote. Kirby Ong, founder of HypurrCollective, noted that the ultimate decision will likely depend on validator alignments with their current stakers, as well as the sentiment reflected in prediction markets. Ong emphasized that while prediction markets can set expectations, it is the validator support that will ultimately determine the candidates for the USDH ticker.

In addition to Ethena, other contenders are also in the running. Paxos, backed by PayPal, has revised its proposal to emphasize a larger share of reserve yield to Hyperliquid’s Assistance Fund, deferring any issuer take until the product scales past $1 billion. Recently, Paxos announced it had received an offer from Kraken to list USDH and HYPE from day one, pending the exchange's standard review. Despite being a new company, Native Markets currently leads the race with a 90% chance of winning the vote, according to live data from Myriad Markets. Native Markets has proposed a GENIUS-compliant USDH managed through Bridge, Stripe’s stablecoin issuer, with reserves overseen by BlackRock.

As the vote approaches, the competitive landscape for the USDH stablecoin ticker remains dynamic. Other contenders include Sky, the issuer of USDS, Frax Finance, and Agora, each with unique proposals and strategies. The final outcome on Sunday will likely hinge on which team can garner the most trust and perceived long-term value within the ecosystem.

In summary, Arthur Hayes' substantial investment in Ethena underscores the competitive nature of the USDH stablecoin race, with significant implications for the crypto market and DeFi ecosystem.

**Market Context:** The ongoing developments in the stablecoin sector, particularly with USDH, reflect broader trends in the cryptocurrency market, where regulatory considerations and competitive dynamics are increasingly influencing project viability and investor interest.

Takeaway: Hayes' investment highlights the strategic importance of the upcoming USDH vote in the evolving landscape of stablecoins.
