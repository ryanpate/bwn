- RLUSD's market cap reached approximately $730 million in September 2024.

Ripple Labs is pursuing a national trust bank charter from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to establish the "Ripple National Trust Bank" in New York. This move aims to support digital asset activities, particularly the issuance and custody of its stablecoin, RLUSD. The application raises critical questions about the future of XRP, Ripple's native cryptocurrency, and its role in the evolving landscape of digital finance.

The OCC's charter would place RLUSD within the U.S. banking system, aligning it with new federal regulations governing payment stablecoins. The GENIUS Act, enacted in July 2024, outlines who can issue stablecoins, including reserve and redemption requirements, while prohibiting issuers from offering yield or interest to holders. This law creates a framework for both federal and state-qualified issuers, potentially benefiting Ripple's operations.

RLUSD was launched in December 2024 and integrated into Ripple Payments by April 2025, achieving a market capitalization of nearly $250 million at that time. Recent data indicates RLUSD's outstanding supply is around $730 million, positioning it among the leading dollar-pegged tokens. If Ripple secures the OCC charter, RLUSD could operate under a federal framework, enhancing its credibility and operational scope.

The implications for XRP are complex. Currently, every transaction on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) incurs a small fee paid in XRP, which is subsequently burned. This mechanism has been adjusted to lower the reserve requirements for accounts, making it easier for new users to participate. However, the question remains whether RLUSD's growth could diminish XRP's role as a bridge asset in transactions. If RLUSD becomes the primary settlement asset for enterprise payment flows, XRP might see reduced utility in certain corridors.

Conversely, an increase in RLUSD's activity on XRPL could drive demand for XRP as a liquidity tool, particularly in automated market maker (AMM) settings. Ripple's plans to enable AMM functionality on XRPL by March 2025 suggest that stablecoin growth could enhance XRP's use in liquidity routing, thereby maintaining its relevance in the ecosystem.

The regulatory landscape is also evolving, with the EU's MiCA framework imposing restrictions on stablecoin issuers and the Bank of England proposing limits on systemic stablecoins. An OCC charter would facilitate RLUSD's integration into these international dialogues, potentially easing its acceptance among large banks and regulated financial venues.

Despite ongoing litigation, including a recent $125 million penalty in the SEC case, Ripple's application for a national charter indicates a strategic pivot towards compliance and regulatory alignment. The proposed bank structure aims to ring-fence activities, ensuring adherence to the new stablecoin laws.

In summary, Ripple's pursuit of an OCC national charter could significantly impact both RLUSD and XRP. While RLUSD may gain enhanced status as a bank-issued stablecoin, XRP's role as a liquidity asset on XRPL is likely to persist. The interplay between these two assets will depend on market dynamics and regulatory developments, shaping the future of Ripple's offerings in the crypto space. 

The outcome of Ripple's charter application could redefine the operational landscape for both RLUSD and XRP, marking a pivotal moment in the evolution of digital assets within the U.S. financial system.
