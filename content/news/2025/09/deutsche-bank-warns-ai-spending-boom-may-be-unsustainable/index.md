### TL;DR
- AI capital expenditures are preventing a U.S. recession, according to Deutsche Bank.
- Global AI-related capital expenditures hit $368 billion from early 2023 to August 2025.
- By 2030, the AI sector may face an $800 billion revenue shortfall.
- Productivity gains from AI are expected but not at the pace justifying current spending.
- The AI boom's rapid growth could lead to overcapacity and financial market risks.

The ongoing boom in artificial intelligence (AI) spending is playing a crucial role in sustaining the U.S. economy, according to a recent report from Deutsche Bank. However, the bank has raised alarms about the sustainability of this trend, suggesting that the current trajectory could lead to significant economic challenges in the future.

Deutsche Bank's research highlights that AI capital expenditures have reached unprecedented levels, effectively keeping the economy from slipping into recession. The bank's findings are echoed by the Kobeissi Letter, which noted that investment in software and technology has contributed more than 1 percentage point to U.S. real GDP growth for the first time, surpassing levels seen during the dot-com bubble in 1998. This unprecedented growth is largely attributed to the AI boom, which is seen as a driving force behind economic expansion.

Despite this positive outlook, Deutsche Bank warns that the rapid pace of spending is outstripping actual productivity gains from AI technologies. The bank points to a staggering $368 billion in global AI-related capital expenditures between early 2023 and August 2025, with most funds directed towards physical infrastructure such as data centers and power supply upgrades. However, the expected leap in productivity and efficiency from AI software has yet to materialize significantly. Without these infrastructure investments, Deutsche Bank estimates that real GDP growth in the U.S. would stagnate around 0% in 2024 and 2025.

The implications of this situation are concerning. Deutsche Bank indicates that for the tech sector to continue contributing positively to GDP, growth would need to accelerate dramatically, a scenario deemed mathematically improbable. This raises questions about the sustainability of the current AI boom, which appears to be a fast-paced sprint rather than a steady, sustainable growth trajectory. As tech stocks have driven approximately half of the S&P 500's gains this year, the potential risks extend beyond GDP figures to broader financial markets.

Adding to the skepticism, consultancy Bain & Co. projects that by 2030, the AI sector will require $2 trillion annually to meet the demand for computing power. However, even with anticipated efficiency gains and cost savings, there is an expected shortfall of $800 billion. This gap raises critical questions about who will bear the financial burden if demand for AI computing does not align with revenues, potentially leading to a scenario of overcapacity and squeezed profit margins reminiscent of the dot-com era.

On a more optimistic note, Goldman Sachs believes that productivity gains from AI will eventually emerge, with projections suggesting a boost to U.S. GDP of about 0.4 percentage points per year in the near term, and approximately 1.5% in the long run. While these figures do not indicate explosive growth, they suggest a potential for a softer landing compared to a severe downturn.

Deutsche Bank's balanced perspective acknowledges that while productivity improvements are on the horizon, they are not occurring at a pace that justifies the current levels of spending. The ongoing investment in AI may indeed transform the economy, but the timelines for these changes do not align with the current fervor for building infrastructure.

As it stands, AI capital expenditures are keeping various sectors, such as construction and utilities, active while also supporting equity markets. However, the critical question remains: is this economic foundation robust enough, or is there a risk of creating a multi-trillion-dollar house of cards that could collapse under its own weight?

In conclusion, while the AI boom is currently a driving force for the U.S. economy, its sustainability is under scrutiny, raising important questions about future growth and market stability.
