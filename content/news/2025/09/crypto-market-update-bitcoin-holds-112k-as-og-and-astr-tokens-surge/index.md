The cryptocurrency market has shown signs of recovery over the past 24 hours, with Bitcoin successfully defending its support level at $112,000. This stability in Bitcoin's price has positively influenced the broader market, leading to a rise in the CoinDesk 20 Index by over 1%. Notably, the OG token from the decentralized AI operating system 0G has surged more than 50%, while Avalanche's AVAX token has increased by 10%. Other tokens such as MNT, ASTR, CRO, NEAR, and XLM have also recorded significant gains.

The recent surge in the OG token follows the rollout of the Aristotle mainnet on September 18, which marked the transition of the 0G project from a testnet to a fully operational AI-focused layer-1 blockchain. The launch strategy for the OG token included community rewards for early contributors, active participants in community campaigns, Discord users, and holders of specific NFTs, which has contributed to its rapid rise. Currently, the OG token boasts a market capitalization of $1.23 billion, with a daily trading volume of $3.3 billion, according to CoinMarketCap. The tokenomics are designed to balance short- and long-term incentives, with a total supply of 1 billion tokens, of which 21.3% is unlocked immediately.

Before and during its launch, 0G Labs raised over $350 million, including a $40 million seed round and a $250 million token purchase commitment, along with additional capital from node sales. Key investors in the project include Hack VC, OKX Ventures, Delphi Ventures, Samsung Next, and Animoca Brands. Following its launch, the OG token achieved rapid listings on major exchanges such as Kraken and Binance, which has helped generate liquidity and visibility early in its lifecycle.

In terms of derivatives, global notional futures open interest has decreased to $102 billion, down from last week's high of $110 billion, as a result of significant liquidations that cleared over-leveraged positions. However, certain tokens such as AVAX, MNT, NEAR, and XMR have bucked the trend, showing notable gains in open interest. For instance, AVAX's open interest surged by 25%, confirming the bullish momentum behind its price rally.

The open interest in ASTR, the native token of the Hyperliquid competitor Aster, has reached $12.63 million, the highest level since January. This increase indicates a growing market interest, particularly as Hyperliquid has lost market share in on-chain perpetuals to rising challengers like Aster and Lighter. Meanwhile, other tokens such as XRP, BNB, ADA, LINK, and Binance-listed 1000SHIB are experiencing negative funding rates, suggesting a dominance of bearish short positions. This situation could potentially lead to a "short squeeze" if the market demonstrates renewed resilience.

The growth in open interest for CME-listed Bitcoin futures has stalled, while options open interest has increased to 52.84K BTC, the highest level since April. In the case of Ethereum, both futures and options open interest are hovering near record highs. On Deribit, the put skews for Bitcoin and Ethereum in short-dated and near-dated options have eased as traders have been pursuing bullish Bitcoin call options. Additionally, on the OTC desk Paradigm, block flows have featured Bitcoin calendar spreads and the writing of Solana put options.

In summary, while Bitcoin's price remains stable, the recent surges in tokens like OG and ASTR highlight the dynamic nature of the crypto market. The shifts in open interest and trading volumes reflect ongoing investor interest and market activity.

Takeaway: The crypto market is showing signs of recovery with Bitcoin holding steady at $112K and significant gains in select tokens.
