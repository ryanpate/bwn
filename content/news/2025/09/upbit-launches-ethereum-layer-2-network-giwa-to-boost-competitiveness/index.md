Upbit, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in South Korea by trading volume, has confirmed its plans to launch GIWA, an Ethereum Layer 2 network. This announcement came on Tuesday, following trademark filings that hinted at the project a month earlier. During a keynote speech at the Upbit Developer Conference, Dunamu CEO Oh Kyung-seok emphasized South Korea's potential to compete aggressively in the global financial infrastructure landscape, extending beyond Asia. He pointed to recent developments in the digital asset space, such as the approval of the first U.S. Bitcoin ETF and the enactment of stablecoin legislation, suggesting that digital assets are evolving rather than merely existing as a speculative bubble.

The context surrounding Upbit's announcement highlights the current state of blockchain development, particularly in South Korea, where the market has remained relatively sidelined compared to advancements in regions like the U.S. and Singapore. A representative from Dunamu expressed hope that GIWA would encourage more domestic developers to create innovative blockchain services, integrate into the Web3 ecosystem, and avoid exclusion from the global market.

GIWA is designed to enhance scalability through Optimistic Rollups and includes privacy features that leverage verified liquidity from Upbit's market data. Additionally, a mobile wallet is being developed to support assets, NFTs, and decentralized applications (dApps). The confirmation of GIWA follows trademark filings made by Dunamu Inc. on August 8, and a public testnet for the Layer 2 chain is currently live.

Rei Nam, the chief technology officer at Lambda256, Dunamu's blockchain technology subsidiary, stated that while GIWA is still in the testnet phase, it represents a significant step in expanding opportunities for both Korean and global developers. Analysts have noted that GIWA's construction on Optimism’s OP Stack aims for one-second block times, which could enhance transaction efficiency.

However, the network's design has raised familiar concerns regarding centralization. Similar to Coinbase’s Base, GIWA is expected to start with a single sequencer under operator control. This model can grant exchanges considerable influence over transaction ordering and the potential for maximal extractable value (MEV) capture. In Ethereum-based Layer 2 networks, the sequencer is responsible for ordering transactions, batching them, and submitting them back to Ethereum for final settlement.

A recent regulatory report indicated that exchange-operated Layer 2 networks might function as trading venues, raising the possibility of increased scrutiny in Asia. Jay Jo, a senior analyst at Seoul-based Tiger Research, pointed out that both Upbit and Coinbase face similar centralization challenges. He noted that these exchanges prioritize financial infrastructure innovation and utility over decentralization, which could lead to comparable operational models.

Despite previous diversification attempts by Upbit, such as initiatives with Levvels, NFTs, and overseas exchanges in Thailand and Indonesia that mostly failed, the exchange operates under the direct supervision of Korean authorities. Jo suggested that Upbit likely reached agreements with regulators before advancing with GIWA. Given the decline in domestic trading volumes since 2021 and intensifying competition, Upbit needs new growth drivers. Jo indicated that building its own blockchain could leverage Upbit's significant user base and liquidity, potentially making it a viable diversification strategy.

In summary, Upbit's launch of the GIWA Layer 2 network marks a strategic move to enhance its competitive edge in the evolving crypto landscape. As the exchange navigates regulatory challenges and market dynamics, GIWA could play a crucial role in fostering innovation within the Korean blockchain ecosystem.
