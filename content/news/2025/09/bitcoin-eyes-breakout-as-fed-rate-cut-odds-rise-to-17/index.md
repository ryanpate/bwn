Bitcoin is currently positioned for a potential breakout toward its all-time high (ATH) as the odds for a 50 basis point (bps) rate cut by the Federal Reserve have climbed to 17%. This speculation is fueled by a significant $21 million bet on Polymarket, indicating that the crypto markets could react strongly to the Fed's decisions. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is set to meet on September 17, and markets are pricing in about 30 bps of easing, with expectations split between a base case of a quarter-point cut and a smaller chance for a larger cut.

As of September 10, the CME Group’s FedWatch tool indicated a near 90% probability for a 25 bps cut, approximately 10% for a 50 bps cut, and almost zero for no change. The implied cut size was estimated to be around 27 to 29 bps. This shift in expectations comes in light of recent economic data that has raised concerns about job creation and inflation. A benchmark from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) revealed that the U.S. economy created about 911,000 fewer jobs through March 2025 than previously reported, marking the largest downward adjustment since 2009.

Inflation metrics show mixed results, with the core Consumer Price Index (CPI) at approximately 3.1% year-over-year in August, while the core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index was reported at 2.9% in July. The Treasury yield curve reflects an easing path, although longer-term yields remain influenced by fiscal dynamics and term premiums. According to a Reuters strategist poll, a steeper yield curve is anticipated by year-end, with projections for the two-year yield around 3.40% and the ten-year yield near 4.25%.

In the lead-up to the FOMC meeting, several economic indicators are set to be released, including producer prices, consumer prices, and retail sales, which could further influence market sentiment. For instance, the Producer Price Index (PPI) showed a decrease of 0.1%, slightly increasing the odds for a 50 bps cut to 10%, while Polymarket's odds dipped to 16%.

Currently, the market consensus leans towards a 25 bps cut, which would adjust the target rate to between 4.00% and 4.25%. Analysts forecast two to three additional cuts in 2025, suggesting a gradual easing path into 2026. In this scenario, rates markets are expected to experience a modest bull steepener, with the two-year yield potentially dropping by 10 to 20 bps in the days following the announcement, while the dollar may decline by about 0.3% to 0.8%.

For the crypto market, a decrease in real yields and a weaker dollar could provide support for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), potentially leading to price movements of 1% to 3%. However, the impact of a single rate cut may be less significant than the overall liquidity path. If the Fed opts for a 50 bps cut, it could be framed as a precautionary measure rather than the beginning of an aggressive easing cycle, which could lead to a more rapid steepening of the yield curve.

Historically, equities tend to respond positively to larger cuts, and Bitcoin has shown sensitivity to shifts in dollar strength and real yields. Following the recent easing bets, Bitcoin reached a record high of approximately $124,000 in mid-August. The market's future trajectory will depend heavily on economic growth indicators, labor market revisions, and inflation trends. If growth weakens, the likelihood of a larger front-loaded easing may increase, while a resurgence in inflation could shift policy discussions.

In summary, the upcoming FOMC meeting and its decisions regarding interest rates are critical for both traditional and crypto markets. The interplay of economic data and Fed guidance will be pivotal in determining market reactions and future price movements for assets like Bitcoin.
