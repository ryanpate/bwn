### TL;DR
- Arc is a Layer-1 blockchain developed by Circle, the issuer of USDC.
- The public testnet is expected in Fall 2025, with a mainnet beta planned for 2026.
- Arc uses USDC for transaction fees, aiming for predictable costs and deterministic finality.
- The blockchain features a modular privacy system to support compliance and confidentiality.
- Circle's Arc aims to enhance institutional adoption of stablecoins in financial operations.

Circle, the company behind the USDC stablecoin, has launched a new blockchain platform called Arc, specifically designed to support stablecoin-focused applications. Unlike traditional blockchains such as Ethereum or Solana, Arc is a Layer-1 network that aims to address the infrastructure challenges faced by stablecoins at an institutional scale. With the growing interest in stablecoins, particularly following the passage of the GENIUS Act in July 2025, Circle's Arc seeks to provide a more suitable environment for stablecoin transactions.

The motivation behind building Arc stems from feedback received from enterprises and developers utilizing USDC across various networks. Rachel Mayer, VP of Product Management at Circle, highlighted that many existing blockchains were not designed with stablecoins in mind, leading to issues such as fee volatility, probabilistic settlement, lack of privacy controls, and fragmented liquidity. Arc aims to tackle these challenges by offering instant and irreversible transaction settlement, predictable fees in stablecoins, optional privacy features, and built-in connections to other blockchains and traditional financial systems.

Arc's development is structured in three phases: a private testnet that began in August 2025, a public testnet expected in Fall 2025, and a mainnet beta scheduled for 2026. By utilizing USDC as its native gas, Arc eliminates the need for volatile tokens to pay transaction fees, allowing for a more stable and predictable fee structure. Circle's fee model is based on Ethereum's EIP-1559 architecture, but it replaces block-level adjustments with a weighted moving average of network demand to keep fees low.

The blockchain's consensus layer is powered by Malachite, a Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) engine based on Tendermint. Currently, validator selection is permissioned, focusing on operational resilience and regulatory compliance, with plans to transition to a permissioned Proof-of-Stake mechanism. To ensure fair execution in financial applications, Circle is developing tools such as encrypted mempools and batch transaction processing.

A significant feature of Arc is its modular privacy system, which allows institutions to balance compliance with confidentiality. The first privacy feature, confidential transfers, hides transaction amounts while keeping addresses visible. Future enhancements will include support for private state, confidential computation, zero-knowledge proofs, and fully homomorphic encryption.

Arc's design also facilitates the connection between fiat and USDC across various blockchains. Tools like Mint convert fiat to USDC on Arc, while CCTP allows for USDC transfers by burning and reminting across chains. The Gateway service offers chain-agnostic USDC balances with built-in liquidity rebalancing for wallets and applications.

Positioned within a competitive blockchain ecosystem that includes public Layer-1 networks and stablecoin-focused chains, Arc differentiates itself through Circle's established presence as the issuer of USDC. By creating a specialized chain for compliant financial operations, Arc aims to extend the use of stablecoins beyond simple payments into areas like real-time settlement and global capital tokenization. Mayer noted that regulatory clarity often drives institutional adoption, making Arc's enterprise-grade design particularly relevant.

In summary, Circle's Arc represents a significant advancement in the blockchain landscape, specifically catering to the needs of stablecoin applications and aiming to enhance institutional adoption in the crypto space.
