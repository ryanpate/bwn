### TL;DR
- Banks are totally keeping the risk-free yield from U.S. treasuries for themselves instead of sharing it with us.
- Nominal yields get wrecked by inflation and taxes, leaving many of us with negative real returns.
- The growing dollar supply is like a slow leak, reducing our moneyâ€™s value over time, making it a poor long-term store of value.
- Rich folks dodge these issues by holding onto assets like stocks, gold, and, you guessed it, cryptocurrencies.
- The game plan? Keep some cash for short-term stuff and stash your long-term wealth in a mix of assets, including crypto.

Alright, letâ€™s get real. A lot of us think popping our cash in a bank is a good idea, right? Well, this article from Bankless calls it a "three-layer scam" and frankly, itâ€™s wild. It dives into how banks, inflation, and monetary policies are basically eroding our hard-earned cash when we save in traditional bank accounts. Spoiler alert: there are way better options out there.

First up, letâ€™s talk about that first scam. Banks are sitting on the risk-free yield from U.S. government treasuries â€“ currently chilling at around 4.2% with basically zero risk, but guess what? Theyâ€™re not passing that sweet yield on to us. Nope, theyâ€™re keeping all that juicy return for themselves by investing our deposited dollars into treasuries or money markets. Meanwhile, the wealthy folks are smartly bypassing banks altogether by holding cash directly in treasuries. And us middle-class savers? Weâ€™re just watching that free income slip right through our fingers. Talk about unfair, right?

Next up is the second scam, which is a real doozy. The yield we think weâ€™re getting is totally nominal and not even close to real. With inflation eating away at our purchasing power every year, weâ€™re often left with returns that canâ€™t keep up. Like, over the past four years, real yields have been in the red for most of that time. So yeah, weâ€™re effectively losing money. And donâ€™t even get me started on taxesâ€”those nominal yields get taxed as income, making our returns even worse. Itâ€™s like inflation is a sneaky tax imposed by the government and central banks that hits us hardest. Ugh.

Now, the third scam is, like, the most fundamental one. The money weâ€™re saving isnâ€™t even a reliable store of value. The U.S. dollar supply just keeps expanding, which totally dilutes the value of each dollar over time. This is hardly ever talked about but itâ€™s a huge deal if you want to preserve your wealth. Historical data shows that putting your money into assets like gold or stocks has outperformed just holding cash in dollars over time. Basically, dollars are great for buying stuff, but not so great for saving long-term.

So, whatâ€™s the move? The article suggests keeping dollars only for short-term needsâ€”think daily expenses, taxes, and those pesky emergencies. For some yield, consider holding short-term treasuries or money market funds. But for the long haul? Youâ€™ll want to invest in a diverse portfolio of stuff, including stocks, real estate, gold, and of course, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether. Yeah, they can be a bit bumpy (hello, volatility), but that doesnâ€™t mean theyâ€™re too risky if youâ€™re in it for the long game. Plus, using crypto tools and exchanges can keep you on the cutting edge of financial innovation without diving headfirst into risky territory.

This whole perspective flips the script on traditional financial advice and really shows how inflation, taxes, and monetary policies mess with us savers. Understanding real yields and the dynamics of money supply is key to preserving our wealth. And letâ€™s be real, the rise of cryptocurrencies is shaking things up in a big way, giving us fresh opportunities to store wealth outside of the usual banking system.

Market context? Well, in a world where interest rates are all over the place and inflation is still lurking, traditional bank savings accounts are often dishing out yields lower than inflation. This means weâ€™re looking at negative real returns. Meanwhile, cryptocurrencies and alternative assets are getting some love as possible hedges against inflation and currency devaluation, even though they come with their own set of risks and wild price swings.

To wrap it all up, this article is basically saying that saving your cash in banks can lead to lost yield, hidden inflation taxes, and the slow devaluation of your money. It pushes for a more strategic approach that balances short-term cash management with long-term asset allocationâ€”especially including cryptoâ€”to help protect and grow our wealth over time.
