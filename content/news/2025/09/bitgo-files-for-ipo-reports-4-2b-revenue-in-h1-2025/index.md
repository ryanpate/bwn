Crypto custodian BitGo has taken a significant step towards becoming a publicly traded company by filing its first public S-1 registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The company plans to list its Class A common stock on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol BTGO. This move marks an important milestone for BitGo, showcasing its business scale and financial performance in the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency landscape.

Founded in 2013 and headquartered in Palo Alto, BitGo has established a strong reputation in the crypto industry by providing cold storage and multi-signature wallets tailored for exchanges, hedge funds, and banks. The company has seen substantial growth in its revenue, reporting $4.19 billion for the first half of 2025. This figure represents a nearly fourfold increase from the $1.12 billion recorded in the same period the previous year. However, despite this impressive revenue growth, BitGo's profitability has faced challenges. The company's net income for the first half of 2025 fell to $12.6 million, a decrease from $30.9 million during the same timeframe in 2024. Rising operating costs have contributed to this decline, tightening profit margins.

In 2024, BitGo reported a total revenue of $3.08 billion and a net income of $156.6 million, with $54.1 million attributable to common stockholders. The company's assets under management are substantial, with over $90 billion in cryptocurrency held on its platform, catering to approximately 1.14 million users. However, these assets are heavily concentrated in a small number of cryptocurrencies. According to the S-1 filing, the majority of BitGo's assets on platform (AoP) are held in five digital assets: Bitcoin, Sui, Solana, XRP, and Ethereum, which account for 48.5%, 20.1%, 5.7%, 3.9%, and 3.0% of the AoP, respectively, as of June 30, 2025.

The S-1 filing also outlines a dual-class share structure, which will allow Class B shareholders, including co-founder and CEO Mike Belshe, to have 15 votes per share compared to one vote for Class A stockholders. This structure ensures that Belshe retains control of the company after the IPO, classifying BitGo as a “controlled company” under NYSE regulations. The company has indicated that proceeds from the IPO will be utilized for technology development, acquisitions, and stock-based compensation, while also enhancing its visibility and financial flexibility.

BitGo's IPO filing comes at a time when other major players in the cryptocurrency sector, such as Circle, Gemini, and CoinDesk’s parent company Bullish, are also pursuing public listings. This trend reflects the growing interest and potential for expansion within the cryptocurrency market, as companies seek to capitalize on the increasing mainstream acceptance of digital assets.

In summary, BitGo's IPO filing signals a significant development in the crypto industry, showcasing its robust revenue growth and substantial assets under management, despite recent challenges in profitability. As companies continue to navigate the evolving regulatory landscape and market dynamics, BitGo's public offering will be closely watched by investors and industry participants alike.

Takeaway: BitGo's IPO filing highlights its growth and challenges in the competitive crypto sector.
