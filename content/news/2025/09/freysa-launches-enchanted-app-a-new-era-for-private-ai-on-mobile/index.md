Freysa, an experimental AI organization within the Ethereum ecosystem, has recently launched its Enchanted mobile app, which aims to provide innovative solutions for private AI usage on mobile devices. This app combines both open-source and closed-source AI models, offering users a unique approach to leveraging personal data while maintaining privacy.

The need for privacy in AI has become increasingly critical as concerns grow over data security and exploitation. Current AI systems often process sensitive information, making it vulnerable to breaches and misuse. Freysa's Enchanted app addresses these issues by allowing users to interact with AI models without exposing their private data.

Launched last week, the Enchanted app offers two distinct approaches to private AI: it utilizes open-source models like DeepSeek R1 and Llama 3.3 70B, which run within Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), and it features a closed-source model accessed through layered anonymization. This dual approach sets Freysa apart from other privacy-focused AI applications, which typically rely solely on open-source models that may not perform as well as their closed-source counterparts.

The app's functionality is based on a two-model system that employs custom-trained small language models (SLMs). Users can submit sensitive queries to the SLM, which replaces identifiable information with semantically equivalent placeholder terms. This sanitized prompt is then sent to a closed-source AI model, such as those from OpenAI or Claude, for processing. The response is subsequently returned to the local model, which decodes it, thus providing users with high-quality AI responses while preserving their privacy.

Freysa's approach to anonymization is guided by specific principles that help distinguish between private and public information. While there is a risk of misidentifying data, the team is confident in their model's effectiveness, achieving an anonymization score of 9.55/10, closely following GPT-4.1's score of 9.77/10, despite being significantly smaller in size.

In addition to anonymization, Freysa implements network-level safeguards through TEEs and traffic obfuscation to protect against potential breaches. This system aims to mask individual users within a larger pool, making it more difficult for external parties to track usage patterns.

However, Freysa acknowledges certain limitations. Users with unique query patterns may still be identifiable, and the effectiveness of network protection can vary based on relay network availability and TEE implementation. Additionally, users must place trust in Freysa's system to ensure it operates as designed.

Looking ahead, Freysa plans to enhance the Enchanted app by introducing support for multimodal models that can process images, audio, and text. The team also aims to develop a smart routing system that automatically selects the best AI model for user queries and is working on an improved anonymization model that can run directly on mobile devices, ensuring sensitive data never leaves the user's device.

The launch of the Enchanted app signifies a noteworthy advancement in the integration of privacy within AI technologies. As the crypto industry continues to prioritize open-source principles and user sovereignty, Freysa's innovative approach could pave the way for future developments in private AI solutions. While the Enchanted app may not yet be the ultimate 'Ledger for AI,' it represents a meaningful step towards enhancing privacy in everyday technology.

In conclusion, Freysa's Enchanted app offers a compelling solution for users seeking to navigate the complexities of privacy and performance in AI, marking a significant milestone in the evolution of private AI technologies.
