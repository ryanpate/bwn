A recent discussion on social media highlighted an intriguing perspective on cryptocurrency assets, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum. The conversation revolved around the idea of coordinating around a single asset to leverage its value for loans, humorously referred to as an 'infinite money glitch.' This notion sparked various responses, with some asserting that Bitcoin embodies this concept as the first asset created by the people, for the people. However, the discussion also drew attention to Ethereum, positioning it not merely as an asset but as a broader project that holds significant promise for humanity.

Ethereum is often described as more than just a blockchain or a cryptocurrency; it is perceived as a project that facilitates coordination among people. Proponents argue that Ethereum represents a collective effort to build economically valuable code that can be passed down through generations. This vision extends beyond mere financial transactions to encompass a transformative potential for global peace, wealth, and happiness. Advocates believe that if humanity can unite around Ethereum as a neutral financial foundation, it could lead to unprecedented progress.

The belief in Ethereum's potential is framed as a long-term endeavor, suggesting that the benefits of this project will not materialize in a few years but rather over decades. The argument posits that the creation of numerous effective smart contracts will yield significant second and third-order effects, contributing to the overarching goal of human coordination. However, the path is not without challenges. While some embrace the vision of Ethereum as a collective project, others appear to focus on dismantling its structure for personal gain. This phenomenon, referred to as Ethereum unbundling, reflects a political disposition within the community.

Critics of Ethereum's vision often draw parallels to Bitcoin's staunch supporters, suggesting that both groups share distinct ideological traits. Just as Bitcoin advocates adhere to principles of Austrian economics and individualism, Ethereum unbundlers may exhibit similar tendencies. This divergence raises questions about the community's cohesion and the future trajectory of the Ethereum project.

The discussion around Ethereum also highlights a fundamental difference in how it is perceived compared to Bitcoin. While Bitcoin is often seen as a unique asset with a capped supply of 21 million coins, Ethereum is characterized by its ongoing nature as a project dedicated to fostering open-source contributions. This distinction positions Ethereum as a 'special snowflake' in its own right, representing a continuous effort to develop the most effective coordination software for humanity.

In terms of market context, Ethereum's role as a foundational layer for decentralized applications and finance continues to evolve. Its potential for innovation and collaboration remains a focal point for developers and users alike. As the crypto landscape matures, the dialogue surrounding Ethereum's purpose and impact will likely persist, influencing both its adoption and the broader market.

In summary, the conversation about Ethereum encapsulates a vision of collective human progress through coordination and open-source development. While challenges exist, the belief in Ethereum as a project for humanity's future continues to inspire many within the crypto community.
