Tether and Circle, two of the largest stablecoin issuers, are currently capitalizing on the high-interest rate environment in the United States. According to Dan Reecer, co-founder of Wormhole, these companies are effectively 'printing money' by keeping the yield generated from U.S. Treasuries that back their tokens. This situation raises concerns for stablecoin holders, who do not receive any of the returns from these investments.

At a recent panel discussion at Mercado Bitcoin's DAC 2025 event, Reecer highlighted that Tether reported a net profit of $4.9 billion in the second quarter of the year, which has contributed to a significant increase in the company's valuation, reportedly reaching $500 billion in a new funding round. As interest rates remain elevated, Reecer suggested that users may soon expect a share of the profits or look for alternatives.

In response to this growing demand, new platforms such as M^0 and Agora are emerging. These platforms are designed to build stablecoin infrastructure that routes yield directly to applications or end users, rather than allowing issuers like Tether and Circle to capture all the returns. Reecer pointed out that holding a stablecoin like USDC results in an opportunity cost for users, as they miss out on potential earnings while the issuers profit from U.S. Treasury yields.

Currently, Tether and Circle do not share the yield generated from their stablecoins with users, a practice that could attract regulatory scrutiny. Instead, alternative financial products, such as money market funds, are gaining traction. These funds allow investors to gain exposure to the yields associated with stablecoins. Earlier this year, Circle acquired Hashnote for $1.3 billion, the issuer of the tokenized money market fund USYC, which aims to facilitate the convertibility between cash and yield-bearing collateral on blockchains.

Despite the growth of money market funds, they still represent a small segment of the overall stablecoin market. Data from RWA.xyz indicates that the market capitalization of money market funds is around $7.3 billion, compared to the global stablecoin market, which has surpassed $290 billion. A spokesperson for Tether emphasized that USDT serves as a digital dollar rather than an investment product, stating that it is relied upon by 'hundreds of millions of people,' particularly in emerging markets where it acts as a safeguard against inflation and banking instability.

The spokesperson further noted that while a few percentage points of yield may not significantly impact wealthier individuals in developed countries, they can represent substantial savings for USDT users in regions facing inflation rates as high as 50% to 90% year-over-year. They cautioned that passing along yield could fundamentally alter the nature, risk profile, and regulatory treatment of stablecoins. Competitors exploring yield-bearing stablecoins are targeting a different audience and may assume additional risks.

During the panel, Stephen Richardson from Fireblocks discussed the broader evolution of the stablecoin market towards real-world applications, including cross-border payments and foreign exchange services. He highlighted that the instant transfer of tokenized money could address existing challenges such as slow corporate payment processes and high remittance costs. Financial innovation is already being observed in the sector, with tokenized money market funds being utilized as collateral on exchanges.

In summary, while Tether and Circle continue to profit from high-interest rates, emerging platforms are responding to user demands for yield-sharing mechanisms. The stablecoin market is evolving, with innovations aimed at enhancing real-world use cases and addressing existing financial inefficiencies.
