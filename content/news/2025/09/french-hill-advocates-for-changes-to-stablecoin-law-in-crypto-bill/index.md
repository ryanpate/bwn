In recent developments regarding U.S. crypto legislation, Representative French Hill has expressed support for revisions to the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act. This initiative comes as part of broader efforts to establish a comprehensive market structure for digital assets, with a target completion date set for the end of the year.

The GENIUS Act represents a significant legislative achievement for the crypto industry, having been passed after extensive discussions and revisions in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. As federal regulators begin to implement oversight measures for U.S. stablecoin issuers, lawmakers are now looking to enhance the existing framework.

During a recent event hosted by CoinDesk in Washington, Hill emphasized the importance of refining the GENIUS Act, particularly in light of the House's Clarity Act, which was passed earlier this year. This act included provisions aimed at revising the stablecoin law, which had only recently been established. Hill and Senator Cynthia Lummis, who is a key figure in the Senate's crypto initiatives, are advocating for amendments that would strengthen the regulatory framework surrounding stablecoins.

The proposed changes include several key provisions: 
1. A requirement for CEOs and chief financial officers of stablecoin issuers to be held legally accountable for the accuracy of financial disclosures, supported by annual audits from accounting firms. 
2. A stricter prohibition on non-financial companies entering the stablecoin market, aimed at ensuring that only qualified entities can issue stablecoins. 
3. Assurance that U.S. investors can maintain their own hardware or software wallets for the custody of digital assets and engage in peer-to-peer transactions without regulatory hindrances.

Lummis has indicated her intention to respect the House's amendments while incorporating necessary modifications to the GENIUS Act as part of the Senate's market structure bill. She noted that while she prefers the House's version, collaboration is essential to achieve a balanced outcome. Hill reiterated this sentiment, highlighting that the goal is to enhance the existing law based on the collective work of both chambers.

The Senate Banking Committee has been working on its draft version of the market structure bill, with some members, including Lummis, optimistic about finalizing it by the end of the month. However, challenges remain, as some senators, like John Kennedy from Louisiana, have expressed concerns regarding the Senate's readiness to advance the legislation.

Despite these hurdles, Hill remains confident that bipartisan efforts in the Senate will lead to a successful outcome. He noted that teams from both parties are collaborating to reach a consensus on the necessary changes to the GENIUS Act and the broader market structure for crypto assets.

As the timeline for these legislative efforts progresses, crypto advisers within the administration, including Tyler Williams from the Treasury Department, are focused on transforming the market structure initiatives into law by the year's end. This timeline reflects the urgency and importance of establishing a clear regulatory framework for the rapidly evolving digital asset landscape.

In summary, the ongoing discussions around the GENIUS Act and the Clarity Act represent a crucial step in shaping the future of stablecoin regulation in the U.S., with significant implications for the crypto market and its participants.

Takeaway: The proposed revisions to the GENIUS Act signal a significant legislative effort to strengthen stablecoin regulations in the U.S.
