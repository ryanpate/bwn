### TL;DR
- Current internet dominated by giants like Amazon and Google.
- Web3's original vision was to create a decentralized internet.
- State channels enable fast, secure peer-to-peer transactions.
- ERC-7824 design mitigates risks in digital commerce.
- New model promotes autonomy in business and data management.

The internet today is largely controlled by a few dominant platform giants, such as Amazon and Google, raising concerns about user autonomy and data ownership. Innovations in decentralized technologies, particularly state channels, are being proposed as a solution to reclaim the original vision of Web3, which aimed to create a decentralized internet free from these digital landlords.

Web3, as articulated by Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood in 2014, was envisioned as a 'post-Snowden web,' designed to counteract centralized control through peer-to-peer trust. However, the evolution of the space has seen a shift in focus from its foundational principles to financial gains, with many initial coin offerings (ICOs) prioritizing speculation over technological advancement. This shift contributed to a brief surge in the crypto market cap, which reached nearly $3 trillion during the 2021 bull market, but also led to a dilution of the Web3 concept into a marketing term.

The dominance of centralized platforms is largely due to their role as trusted intermediaries. Users depend on Amazon for secure payment processing and dispute resolution, while Google is trusted to curate and present information. This reliance creates a 'golden cage,' where intermediaries control the rules, data, and a significant portion of the value generated. Early attempts at a decentralized Web3 sought to address this issue through on-chain transactions, which provide a public and permanent record of interactions. However, this approach is akin to running a global commerce system on a single congested highway, which is impractical for real-world commerce that requires speed and complexity.

State channels offer a promising alternative infrastructure. They can be likened to high-speed, private lanes that allow two parties to interact without the congestion of the blockchain. With state channels, thousands of transactions—ranging from value transfers to data permissions—can occur almost instantaneously and at no cost, with each step cryptographically verified. The ERC-7824 design addresses the primary concern of peer-to-peer commerce: the risk that one party may not fulfill their obligations. By requiring both parties to commit funds to an on-chain smart contract before transacting, the system ensures that if one party defaults, the other is compensated through the security deposit.

This innovation has significant implications for commerce and data management. For instance, instead of relying on Amazon and incurring fees of up to 50% of revenue, buyers and sellers can establish a direct channel governed by an impartial smart contract. Similarly, users can maintain control over their personal data by granting temporary, compensated access to applications, which can be revoked at any time. This blend of on-chain security and off-chain efficiency paves the way for the emergence of the autonomous enterprise—a model where business logic is encoded in smart contracts, executed transparently, and operates globally without traditional corporate structures.

The evolution of Bitcoin and Ethereum has already demonstrated the potential to eliminate reliance on centralized authorities for currency and contract enforcement. The next step is to remove the necessity for users to depend on platforms that dictate terms and conditions. By leveraging state channels, the vision of a decentralized, user-empowered internet may finally be within reach.

In summary, the development of state channels represents a critical advancement in the quest for a decentralized web, challenging the dominance of established platforms and promoting greater autonomy for users and businesses alike.
