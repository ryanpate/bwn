AI firm Showrunner is embarking on an ambitious project to reconstruct 43 minutes of lost footage from Orson Welles’ 1942 film, "The Magnificent Ambersons." This effort will utilize a combination of artificial intelligence and traditional filmmaking techniques to create an interpretation of the missing scenes, drawing from archival research and set photos. The project is set to unfold over the next two years, although it is important to note that Showrunner does not hold the rights to the original film, meaning the final product will not be available for commercial release.

The original version of "The Magnificent Ambersons" was edited down from Welles' intended 131-minute cut to just 87 minutes by RKO Studios, which also added a new ending against the director's wishes. Welles expressed great frustration over the alterations, stating, "They destroyed 'Ambersons' and it destroyed me." The film's negatives were ultimately destroyed to make room in RKO's vault, and a rough cut that had been sent to Welles was lost, leaving cinephiles yearning for what could have been.

Showrunner's CEO, Edward Saatchi, described the reconstruction as an "academic" effort, emphasizing that the goal is not to commercialize the 43 minutes but rather to allow them to exist after decades of speculation about the film's original form. Brian Rose, a filmmaker who has previously worked on reconstructing Welles' works, will collaborate with Showrunner on this project. Rose has a history of using archival records, voice actors, and animation to approximate Welles’ vision for his films.

The new version of the film will incorporate live footage featuring new actors, while AI deepfake technology will be employed to replicate the likenesses of the original cast. This innovative approach raises questions about the future of film restoration and the role of AI in creative processes.

The history of "The Magnificent Ambersons" is marked by the challenges of preserving Welles' vision. The film serves as a follow-up to Welles’ acclaimed "Citizen Kane," often regarded as one of the greatest films ever made. The loss of the original cut has rendered the film a subject of fascination and a kind of holy grail for film enthusiasts.

This is not the first time efforts have been made to restore Welles' works posthumously. In 1998, editor Walter Murch used a memo from Welles to create a restored version of "Touch of Evil." Additionally, in 2018, Netflix funded the restoration of Welles’ long-lost film "The Other Side of the Wind," which had been trapped in legal disputes for years. Furthermore, Welles' voice has been digitally recreated using AI for various projects, showcasing the growing intersection of technology and film.

Showrunner, which positions itself as the "Netflix of AI," is focused on generative storytelling. Its platform allows users to create animated show episodes using prompts or photos. Saatchi has described the generative content as a new artistic medium, and the reconstruction of Welles’ missing footage is viewed as a significant step toward the future of storytelling using AI. He noted that while current AI models struggle to maintain narrative coherence beyond short episodes, the technology is evolving rapidly.

This reconstruction project not only highlights the ongoing efforts to preserve cinematic history but also raises important discussions about the implications of AI in creative fields. As technology continues to advance, the possibilities for storytelling and film restoration may expand in unforeseen ways. 

In conclusion, Showrunner's initiative to reconstruct "The Magnificent Ambersons" represents a blend of nostalgia and innovation, aiming to bring lost cinematic moments back to life through the lens of modern technology.
