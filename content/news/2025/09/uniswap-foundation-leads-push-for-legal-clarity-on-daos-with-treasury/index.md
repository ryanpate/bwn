The Uniswap Foundation has spearheaded a coalition of 18 major cryptocurrency organizations urging U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to provide clearer federal legal guidance for decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). In a letter dated September 2, the coalition highlighted the ongoing legal uncertainties that have driven blockchain innovation offshore and advocated for the adoption of Wyoming’s Decentralized Unincorporated Nonprofit Association (DUNA) framework as a federal model.

DAOs are blockchain-based entities governed by code and community consensus rather than traditional corporate structures. Despite their growing prominence in decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web3, DAOs have faced persistent legal ambiguity in the United States regarding their ability to enter contracts, manage treasury assets, and comply with tax laws without exposing participants to personal liability. This uncertainty has created barriers to innovation and adoption within the U.S. market.

Wyoming’s DUNA framework, enacted into law in 2024, offers a legal structure tailored for DAOs that preserves decentralized governance while granting them the ability to engage in contractual relationships, manage funds, and fulfill tax obligations. It also shields token holders from personal liability, addressing a major concern for DAO participants. The coalition’s letter argues that federal recognition of this framework could provide the clarity DAOs need to operate confidently and compliantly within the U.S.

The initiative has garnered bipartisan political support, notably from Senator Cynthia Lummis, a prominent advocate for blockchain innovation. She has endorsed the DUNA framework and emphasized the importance of building a robust legal foundation for American innovators. The letter also references the President’s Working Group Report on Digital Assets, which calls for collaboration between the Treasury, IRS, and blockchain nonprofits to facilitate U.S. domiciliation of digital asset entities.

Uniswap Governance, described as one of the largest and most active DAOs globally, has proposed adopting the DUNA structure as a pilot case for the broader ecosystem. The coalition contends this represents a significant milestone demonstrating that compliance and decentralization can coexist within U.S. legal frameworks.

The letter was co-signed by a diverse group of 18 organizations, including well-established entities like Polygon, Tally, and the Blockchain Association, as well as newer players such as ZKsync, Morpho, and the Solana Policy Institute. These signatories represent a broad spectrum of the crypto ecosystem, including infrastructure providers, DeFi protocols, venture funds, and policy advocacy groups.

The coalition also warned of the competitive threat posed by other countries actively courting blockchain organizations with clearer regulatory frameworks. They cautioned that continued regulatory ambiguity in the U.S. risks driving innovation and talent offshore, where legal environments are more conducive to decentralized entities.

The letter requests three specific federal actions: recognition of good-faith DAO compliance efforts, active engagement with communities piloting frameworks like DUNA, and the establishment of federal pathways such as safe harbors, interpretive guidance, or tailored rulemaking to support DAO operations.

Market context: As decentralized finance and blockchain-based governance models grow, the lack of clear legal frameworks in the U.S. contrasts with more proactive regulatory approaches abroad. This has led some projects and innovators to relocate or incorporate in jurisdictions offering greater legal certainty, potentially diminishing the U.S.'s leadership in blockchain innovation.

In summary, the coalition led by the Uniswap Foundation is calling for the U.S. Treasury to clarify the legal status of DAOs by adopting Wyoming’s DUNA framework at the federal level, aiming to foster innovation while ensuring compliance and protecting participants.
