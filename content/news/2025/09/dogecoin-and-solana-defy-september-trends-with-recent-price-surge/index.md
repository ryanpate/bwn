In a surprising turn of events, Dogecoin and Solana have shown significant price increases in the past week, defying the historical trend known as 'Red September,' which typically sees declines in the crypto market. Dogecoin surged by over 11%, while Solana saw a nearly 10% rise, indicating a renewed appetite among investors for riskier assets in the cryptocurrency space.

Historically, September has been a challenging month for cryptocurrencies, often marked by downturns. However, recent market conditions have shifted, with the Federal Reserve expected to cut interest rates during its meeting on September 17. Current inflation rates have moderated to 2.9%, providing the Fed with the necessary cover to ease monetary policy, which could lead to increased investment in risk assets, including cryptocurrencies.

The Altcoin Season Index has reached 80 points, the highest level recorded in 2025, signaling strong investor interest in altcoins. Concurrently, the Crypto Fear and Greed Index has climbed from 39 to 53, reflecting a growing bullish sentiment across the market. This positive backdrop is further supported by the performance of traditional markets, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq both reaching record highs.

Dogecoin (DOGE) has been particularly notable, recently breaking out with a price increase of over 11%. However, it has experienced a slight correction, dipping about 5% in the past 24 hours to trade at approximately $0.2649. Despite this recent decline, technical indicators suggest a bullish outlook. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) for Dogecoin stands at 60, indicating strong momentum without entering overbought territory. Additionally, the Average Directional Index (ADX) is at 26, confirming a trending environment. The price has also broken a bullish symmetrical triangle, which is a positive sign for traders.

Key levels for Dogecoin include immediate support at $0.25 and strong support at $0.22, with immediate resistance at $0.28214 and a major psychological barrier at $0.30.

Solana (SOL) has also defied the typical September downturn, rising nearly 10% since last Monday and currently trading around $232, with a market cap exceeding $126 billion. The token peaked at $244.08 before consolidating its gains. Solana has entered a 'golden cross' territory, where the 50-day moving average has crossed above the 200-day moving average, a signal often interpreted as bullish. The RSI for Solana is at 65, indicating strong buying momentum, while the ADX is at 33, suggesting a powerful trend.

However, there are signs that a small correction may be imminent. The Squeeze Momentum indicator shows a bearish impulse, creating a divergence between price action and momentum. This situation indicates that the market may be at an inflection point, where either momentum will align with price for a bullish continuation or a price correction may occur.

On the prediction market Myriad, users are optimistic about Solana's price trajectory, estimating a 90% chance that it will reach $250 before potentially dropping to $130. Additionally, there is a 59% probability that Solana will achieve a new all-time high above $294 this year, an increase from 45% the previous week.

Key levels for Solana include immediate support at $218 and strong support at $207, with immediate resistance at $244.08 and a psychological target of $260.

In summary, both Dogecoin and Solana are showing signs of resilience and bullish momentum, challenging the historical trends of September in the cryptocurrency market. As the Federal Reserve prepares to adjust interest rates, the potential influx of capital into risk assets could further influence these trends.

Takeaway: Dogecoin and Solana are breaking traditional September trends, indicating a shift in investor sentiment in the crypto market.
