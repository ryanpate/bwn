### TL;DR
- Over 150 Ethereum layer 2 networks exist, with many centralized.
- Only firms with significant transaction volume may benefit from their own layer 2.
- Layer 2 networks can be cheaper than launching a new layer 1 blockchain.
- Robinhood's announcement to build a layer 2 network highlights industry interest.
- Most layer 2 networks struggle with low transaction volumes and user engagement.

The rise of Ethereum layer 2 networks has attracted considerable interest from companies looking to enhance their blockchain capabilities. However, according to Paul Brody, EY’s Global Blockchain Leader, most companies may not need to create their own layer 2 solutions. The current landscape reveals that there are already over 150 layer 2 networks, many of which are centralized and tied to specific enterprises. Notably, companies like Robinhood have recently announced plans to develop their own layer 2 networks, further complicating the competitive environment.

Ethereum, which celebrated its 10th anniversary in July 2023, remains the leading smart contract blockchain and the primary host for digital assets, stablecoins, and decentralized finance applications. Its share of the decentralized finance ecosystem has remained stable at approximately 50% over the past three years. Layer 2 networks, which operate on top of Ethereum, benefit from this established ecosystem, enabling companies to leverage Ethereum's strengths while maintaining control over their own environments.

The appeal of launching a layer 2 network is clear; it offers a blend of control and integration with the broader Ethereum ecosystem. Centralized layer 2 networks can dictate their pricing structures and manage access, similar to private blockchains. While these networks must purchase transaction processing space on the Ethereum mainnet, the costs are generally lower than those associated with launching a new layer 1 network. For instance, Coinbase's layer 2 network, Base, reportedly generated $4.9 million in fee revenue in June 2025 while incurring only $50,000 in layer 1 settlement fees.

Despite the potential for profitability, Brody emphasizes that only companies capable of aggregating significant transaction volumes should consider creating their own layer 2 networks. Financial service firms with extensive retail customer bases, like Coinbase and Kraken, are the primary candidates for this model. The key questions for any company contemplating a layer 2 network include whether they can generate substantial transaction volume, if on-chain transactions are central to their business model, and whether their proposed layer 2 network offers a unique value proposition compared to existing options.

Many current layer 2 networks struggle to differentiate themselves in a crowded market, with most reporting less than $1 million in total value locked (TVL) and low user activity. Brody suggests that for most companies, connecting directly to Ethereum or utilizing existing layer 2 networks may prove more beneficial and cost-effective than establishing their own. This approach avoids the complexities and expenses of running a proprietary network.

The recent trend of companies launching their own layer 2 networks mirrors the past enthusiasm for private blockchains, which often failed to deliver on their promises. The allure of controlling one's own ecosystem can be tempting, but the reality is that public chains offer greater openness and interoperability. While centralized layer 2 networks may not be doomed to failure, the likelihood of success for most remains uncertain.

In conclusion, while the layer 2 ecosystem continues to evolve, the majority of companies may find that the optimal strategy lies in collaboration within the existing Ethereum framework rather than pursuing their own isolated networks. The focus should remain on leveraging the strengths of the broader blockchain community to maximize efficiency and innovation.

Takeaway: Most companies should consider the collaborative opportunities within existing Ethereum networks rather than pursuing their own layer 2 solutions.
