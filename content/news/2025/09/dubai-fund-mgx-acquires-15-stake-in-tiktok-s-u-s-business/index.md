MGX, a fund backed by Dubai’s ruling family, has acquired a 15% stake in TikTok's U.S. business. This investment is part of a broader restructuring effort aimed at increasing American control over the popular video-sharing app amid ongoing regulatory scrutiny in Washington.

The deal, which was reported by the Washington Post, positions MGX, chaired by Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, in partnership with Oracle, the technology giant co-founded by Larry Ellison. Together, MGX and Oracle will hold about 45% of TikTok’s U.S. operations. This move is significant as it aligns with the U.S. government's push for more domestic ownership of TikTok, which has faced concerns regarding data privacy and national security.

In addition to MGX's investment, other American investors are expected to secure majority ownership, bringing the total U.S. stake in TikTok to more than 65%. The Chinese parent company, ByteDance, will maintain a minority interest, holding a 19.9% stake in the U.S. entity. This arrangement appears designed to alleviate fears in Washington, where regulatory scrutiny of TikTok has intensified, particularly during the Trump administration.

MGX's involvement in the deal adds an intriguing layer, especially considering its recent $2 billion investment in USD1, a stablecoin introduced by World Liberty Financial, a company associated with Donald Trump. The USD1 stablecoin is backed by U.S. Treasuries and cash equivalents, and it aims to provide users with financial services outside traditional banking systems. MGX has indicated its willingness to utilize USD1 for substantial investments, as evidenced by its previous deployment of the stablecoin in the crypto exchange Binance.

Securing a stake in TikTok not only enhances MGX’s portfolio but also gives it a prominent position in the U.S. social media landscape, where TikTok's influence over culture and advertising continues to grow. This investment could potentially open doors for MGX in the rapidly evolving digital landscape, where social media platforms play a crucial role in shaping consumer behavior and trends.

The implications of this deal extend beyond MGX and Oracle. As American firms increase their ownership in TikTok, it may lead to more stringent oversight of the platform's operations and data practices, aligning with the U.S. government's objectives. This could also impact how TikTok engages with its user base and advertisers, as it adapts to the new ownership structure.

In the broader market context, TikTok's restructuring comes at a time when the crypto market is experiencing significant fluctuations. Recently, combined trading volumes on centralized exchanges reached a yearly high of $9.72 trillion, indicating robust activity in the crypto space. As MGX navigates its new role in TikTok, it will likely keep an eye on these market dynamics, particularly as it relates to its investments in digital assets.

In summary, MGX's acquisition of a 15% stake in TikTok's U.S. business marks a strategic move to enhance American control over the platform while also positioning itself within the competitive landscape of social media and digital finance. The evolving ownership structure may lead to increased regulatory scrutiny and influence how TikTok operates in the future.
