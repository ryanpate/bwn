PunkStrategy, an automated trading protocol for CryptoPunks developed by TokenWorks, has seen remarkable growth since its initial coverage on September 8th. The market cap of the $PNKSTR token has skyrocketed from approximately $1 million to over $21 million within just a week. This surge indicates a significant interest in the protocol, which operates by collecting a 10% swap fee on trades. This fee accumulates into an ETH treasury that is used to purchase the cheapest available CryptoPunk, which is then relisted for sale at a markup of 1.2 times the purchase price. The proceeds from these sales are reinvested into buying and burning $PNKSTR tokens, creating a continuous cycle of trading and value generation.

As PunkStrategy has gained traction, it has successfully acquired nine CryptoPunks, resold one, and decentralized its smart contract. However, the project is set to expand further with the introduction of NFTStrategy, which broadens the original concept to encompass any ERC-721 NFT collection. This new model allows other collections to establish their own self-sustaining token loops, similar to PunkStrategy.

Under NFTStrategy, each NFT collection can be paired with a unique strategy token. Trades involving this token incur a 10% fee, with 8% of that fee pooled into ETH. When the ETH pool reaches the price of the lowest floor NFT in the collection, the protocol purchases it and relists it at a 20% markup. Proceeds from these sales are then used to buy and burn the associated strategy token, perpetuating the cycle. In addition, NFTStrategy introduces several modifications to enhance the model: 1% of every trade is allocated as royalties to the collection creators, and another 1% is directed towards buying and burning $PNKSTR tokens, thereby benefiting the original PunkStrategy ecosystem.

Each NFTStrategy token will launch with a market cap of $50,000 and will have full liquidity available at the outset. To combat sniper bots, the initial trading fees will be set at a steep 95% for the first few minutes before tapering down to the standard 10%. This structure allows holders of strategy tokens to speculate on the price movements of major NFT collections without needing to invest substantial ETH upfront. Furthermore, the protocol is designed to exert consistent buy pressure on the underlying NFTs, potentially increasing their floor prices over time.

TokenWorks plans to debut five initial NFTStrategy tokens: $APESTR for Bored Apes, $PUDGYSTR for Pudgy Penguins, $BIRBSTR for Moonbirds, $MEEBSTR for Meebits, and $DICKSTR for CryptoDickButts. Following the launch of these tokens, the second phase of NFTStrategy will enable owners of any NFT collection to create their own strategy tokens, with a final phase allowing anyone to pay for the creation of such tokens.

The launch of NFTStrategy is scheduled for September 18th. If successful, this initiative could have significant implications for the NFT market, as it aims to transform NFT floors into programmable economic systems that benefit both creators and collectors. The viability of these tokenomic loops will depend on sustained trading activity, but if they gain traction, NFTStrategy could represent the emergence of a new class of financial tools for NFTs. The long-term impact of this experiment remains to be seen, but it is certainly one of the more intriguing developments in the NFT space this year.

In conclusion, NFTStrategy's innovative approach may redefine the interaction between NFT collections and their communities, potentially establishing a new paradigm in the crypto landscape.
