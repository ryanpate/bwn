Bitcoin has shown a slight recovery, trading at approximately $109,300 after briefly dipping below $109,000. Despite this rebound, the cryptocurrency is down 1.5% over the past 24 hours and has seen a decline of 5.9% in the past week, according to data from CoinGecko. This fluctuation in Bitcoin's price comes in the wake of the Bureau of Labor Statistics' report revealing a year-over-year increase in core inflation of 2.9% for August, which is slightly higher than July's figure of 2.6%. 

Core inflation, which excludes the more volatile categories of food and energy, is a crucial indicator for policymakers at the Federal Reserve. The data suggests that while inflationary pressures are gradually easing, there remains a delicate balance for the Fed between managing persistent inflation and signs of a softening labor market. Fabian Dori, chief investment officer at Sygnum Bank, noted that if inflation continues to trend lower, it could bolster confidence in the Fed's easing cycle, potentially supporting risk assets. Conversely, any unexpected increases in inflation data could delay anticipated rate cuts, impacting equities and strengthening the dollar.

In the past 24 hours, the crypto market has experienced significant turbulence, with over $970 million worth of futures contracts liquidated. Of this total, $852 million consisted of long positions that were betting on price increases. The largest single liquidation occurred with a $19.2 million ETH-USDT contract on the HTX exchange. This liquidation wave has left many traders feeling pessimistic, with 69% of users on Myriad, a prediction market, now forecasting Bitcoin to drop to $105,000 before making a move towards $125,000. Just two days prior, sentiment was more evenly split between bullish and bearish predictions.

The recent announcement of new tariffs by President Donald Trump, which will take effect on October 1, may be contributing to this bearish sentiment. The tariffs include a 100% duty on branded drugs and a 25% tariff on heavy-duty trucks, among others. Dean Chen, an analyst at Bitunix, commented that while inflation figures aligning with forecasts kept market reactions subdued, the high tariffs could introduce additional inflationary pressure, complicating growth prospects. This uncertainty is particularly relevant for Bitcoin traders, who are advised to manage leverage carefully and validate market movements through capital flows.

Traders are closely monitoring Bitcoin's support and resistance levels, with $108,000 identified as a key support level and $111,000 as near-term resistance. The market's cautious approach is further reflected in the sentiment surrounding the Federal Reserve's monetary policy. Currently, traders are assigning an 87.7% probability to the Fed approving a 25-basis point rate cut in their upcoming meeting in October, although this figure has slightly decreased from 91.9% the previous week. In contrast, users on Myriad are more pessimistic, with 68% predicting another rate cut.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's recent comments have also influenced market sentiment. During a speech in Rhode Island, Powell expressed a less alarmed view regarding the potential economic effects of tariffs compared to earlier this year, suggesting that the inflationary impacts could be short-lived. As traders and investors digest these developments, the interplay between inflation data, market sentiment, and regulatory actions will continue to shape the landscape for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

In summary, Bitcoin's recent price movements reflect broader economic indicators and market sentiment, with traders navigating a complex environment influenced by inflation data and political developments.
