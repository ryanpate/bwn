This week, Giza, a rapidly growing platform at the intersection of decentralized finance (DeFi) and artificial intelligence (AI), made significant strides with the launch of two new products: Swarms and Pulse. These initiatives aim to enhance yield generation and verification in the DeFi space, showcasing the potential of AI-driven solutions.

Giza operates as a decentralized network that utilizes autonomous agents to optimize capital management. The platform's core philosophy revolves around transforming idle deposits into 'Active Capital,' where funds are actively managed by AI agents seeking the best returns across various DeFi protocols. The results have been promising; Giza's flagship agent, ARMA, reportedly delivers a yield of 15% on USDC, significantly higher than typical DeFi yields. With $20 million in Assets Under Agents (AUA) and a 20% reload rate, where one in five users reinvests their earnings, the platform appears to resonate well with its user base.

The Giza network comprises three primary layers that work together seamlessly: the Semantic Layer, which translates DeFi operations into a format understandable by agents; the Smart Authorization Layer, where users deposit and authorize token usage; and the Decentralized Execution Layer, which executes user instructions on-chain. This week, Giza introduced a fourth layer, Swarms, designed to verify advertised yields through real-time testing, thereby enhancing trust and accountability within the network.

On Monday, Giza launched Swarms, an incentive verification layer aimed at addressing the challenge of verifying yield claims made by various DeFi protocols. Traditionally, users have faced difficulties in confirming the accuracy of advertised yields, making it challenging for agents to make informed decisions. Swarms seeks to create standardized APR (sAPR) metrics based on actual agent testing rather than relying on marketing claims. This innovation allows protocols to present basic incentive offers, which Giza agents will then test to provide verified performance data. This not only benefits protocols by offering measurable results but also encourages competition among them to attract capital, ultimately leading to higher yields for users.

On Wednesday, Giza launched Pulse, an autonomous agent developed in collaboration with Pendle Finance, marking the platform's expansion into fixed-yield strategies. Pulse specifically targets Principal Token (PT) portfolios, allowing users to earn fixed yields without the complexities typically associated with such investments. The agent automates the management of these positions, handling tasks like tracking expiry dates and optimizing allocations across different markets. The initial launch with ETH-PT markets on Arbitrum offered around a 13% APR and successfully filled its $3 million cap in just three hours, reflecting strong demand for simplified yield generation.

The significance of these developments extends beyond just yield optimization. As Giza co-founder Renç Korzay noted, the issues that Pulse addresses—such as user churn and accessibility barriers—are prevalent across the DeFi landscape. By simplifying complex protocols through the use of agents, Giza aims to enhance the overall usability of DeFi, potentially attracting a broader audience.

The introduction of Swarms also opens a new revenue stream for Giza, allowing protocols to pay for access to its network of intelligent agents. This revenue will benefit $GIZA token holders through buybacks and treasury growth, further integrating the token into the platform's ecosystem.

In summary, Giza's recent launches of Swarms and Pulse highlight a growing trend in the DeFi sector, where AI-driven solutions are poised to enhance yield generation and verification. The rapid sellout of Pulse indicates a strong appetite for such innovations, suggesting that users are eager for tools that simplify their investment strategies. As Giza continues to expand its offerings and enhance its infrastructure, it positions itself as a key player in the evolving landscape of DeFi, showcasing the potential of AI to optimize capital management.

Takeaway: Giza's advancements in DeFi yield optimization signal a shift towards more efficient and user-friendly financial tools in the crypto space.
