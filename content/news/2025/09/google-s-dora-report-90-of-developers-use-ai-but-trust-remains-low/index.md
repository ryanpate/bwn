### TL;DR
- 90% of developers use AI tools daily, a 14% increase from last year.
- Only 24% of surveyed developers trust AI-generated information.
- Developers spend a median of two hours daily using AI for coding tasks.
- Over 80% report improved work efficiency due to AI tools.
- Google introduced a DORA AI Capabilities Model to guide AI integration.

In a rapidly evolving technological landscape, Google's 2025 DORA Report highlights a significant trend: nearly all software developers are now utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) tools in their daily coding practices. Released on Wednesday, the report indicates that 90% of developers have integrated AI into their workflows, marking a 14% increase from the previous year. However, despite this widespread adoption, trust in the reliability of AI-generated outputs remains alarmingly low, with only 24% of respondents expressing confidence in the information produced by these tools.

The DORA Report is based on a survey of nearly 5,000 technology professionals worldwide, offering insights into the current state of AI in software development. Developers are reportedly spending a median of two hours each day working with AI assistants, employing these tools for a variety of tasks including code generation, security reviews, debugging, and even educational purposes such as explaining concepts and writing documentation. However, a striking 30% of developers indicated they trust AI outputs either 'a little' or 'not at all.'

Ryan Salva, who oversees Google's coding tools, including the Gemini Code Assist, noted that for engineers at Google, using AI in daily work has become unavoidable. The company's metrics reveal that over a quarter of new code is now generated by AI systems, with CEO Sundar Pichai claiming a 10% productivity boost across engineering teams. This trend illustrates a growing reliance on AI, yet developers approach it with caution, treating it akin to a brilliant but unreliable coworker. While AI is seen as beneficial for brainstorming and routine tasks, developers feel compelled to double-check its outputs.

Interestingly, despite the lack of trust, more than 80% of surveyed developers acknowledged that AI has enhanced their work efficiency, and 59% reported improvements in code quality. However, a paradox emerges as 65% of respondents described themselves as heavily reliant on these tools, with varying degrees of dependence: 37% reported 'moderate' reliance, 20% said 'a lot,' and 8% admitted to 'a great deal' of dependence. This phenomenon aligns with findings from Stack Overflow's 2025 survey, which noted an increase in distrust of AI accuracy from 31% to 46% within just one year, despite a high adoption rate of 84%.

The DORA Report also introduces the DORA AI Capabilities Model, a new framework aimed at helping organizations leverage AI effectively while minimizing risks. This model outlines seven best practices, advocating for user-centric design, clear communication protocols, and 'small-batch workflows' to prevent uncontrolled AI operations. The report categorizes teams into archetypes, ranging from 'Harmonious high-achievers' to those stuck in a 'Legacy bottleneck,' based on how well they manage AI integration. Teams with established processes have seen AI amplify their strengths, while fragmented organizations have experienced AI exposing weaknesses in their workflows.

The full State of AI-assisted Software Development report, along with the DORA AI Capabilities Model documentation, is available through Google Cloud's research portal. These resources provide prescriptive guidance for teams aiming to adopt AI technologies more proactively, assuming they can overcome the trust barrier.

In summary, while AI adoption among developers is at an all-time high, the lack of trust in its outputs presents a significant challenge that the industry must address moving forward.
