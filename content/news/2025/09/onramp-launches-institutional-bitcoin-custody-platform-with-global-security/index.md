Onramp, a Bitcoin-only financial services company, has recently launched an institutional-grade asset management offering. This new platform is built on a multisignature, multi-institutional, and multi-jurisdictional custody model, positioning Onramp as a modern, full-reserve Bitcoin bank. Founded in Texas in 2022 by Michael Tanguma, a former executive from Google and Unchained Capital, Onramp aims to democratize institutional-grade custody, providing a comprehensive suite of financial services tailored for Bitcoin enthusiasts, including IRAs, trusts, bitcoin-backed loans, and inheritance planning. The platform operates globally, excluding nations sanctioned by the U.S., such as Venezuela and Iran, and caters not only to institutions but also to individual Bitcoin holders with significant investments in the asset.

The launch of Onramp's custody platform is significant as it leverages Bitcoin's unique technology to enhance security and accessibility for institutional investors. Historically, wealth custody has been limited to either personal storage methods, like keeping cash at home, or trusting banks to hold assets, which comes with inherent risks. With the advent of Bitcoin, a decentralized and distributed network, users can now utilize multisignature technology to secure their assets. This technology allows for transactions that require multiple independent signatures to be valid, providing a level of security that traditional banking systems cannot match.

Onramp's platform utilizes multisignature accounts, which are akin to shared accounts in traditional banking but are secured through cryptographic methods. This innovation allows users to distribute their keys among various custodians across different jurisdictions, reducing the risks associated with centralized custody. As Tanguma noted, this model offers a significant improvement over existing custody options, which often concentrate assets in a few large exchanges or hardware wallets.

The company has partnered with three independent custodians—BitGo in the U.S., Tetra Trust in Canada, and CoinCover in the UK—to provide a robust security framework. This multi-institutional approach diversifies risk and enhances the financial security of Bitcoin holdings, making it an attractive option for institutional investors. Tanguma highlighted that a substantial portion of Bitcoin's market cap is currently held in hardware wallets, with a significant concentration in platforms like Coinbase and Ledger. He expressed skepticism about the scalability of these existing custody solutions as Bitcoin's value continues to rise.

The introduction of Onramp's custody platform is particularly relevant as the Bitcoin market matures. With the potential for Bitcoin to reach market caps of $20 trillion or more in the coming years, the need for secure and scalable custody solutions becomes increasingly critical. Onramp's innovative approach aims to address these challenges and encourage a more creative and secure delivery of Bitcoin's promises to a broader audience.

In the current market context, the launch of Onramp's custody platform comes at a time when institutional interest in Bitcoin is growing. As more institutions seek to invest in cryptocurrency, the demand for secure custody solutions is expected to rise. Onramp's platform positions the company to capitalize on this trend, offering a viable alternative to traditional custody methods that have dominated the market thus far.

In conclusion, Onramp's launch of its institutional Bitcoin custody platform represents a significant advancement in the security and accessibility of Bitcoin for institutional investors. By leveraging multisignature technology and partnering with established custodians, Onramp aims to reshape the landscape of Bitcoin custody, making it more secure and diversified for users worldwide.
