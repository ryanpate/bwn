Fidelity has made a significant entry into the crypto space with the launch of its Treasury Digital Fund’s OnChain Class, which has already amassed approximately $203.7 million. This development is poised to enhance the trajectory of Ethereum's tokenized U.S. Treasuries, setting the stage for a potential market size of $10 billion by the end of 2025.

As of September 12, 2025, the total value of tokenized U.S. Treasuries on public blockchains stands at $7.42 billion. This figure is primarily driven by large-scale issuances on Ethereum, as tracked by RWA.xyz. Fidelity’s new fund, recorded as the Fidelity Digital Interest Token on the Ethereum blockchain, adds to the growing institutional interest in digital assets. The fund is custodized by the Bank of New York Mellon and is structured to invest at least 99.5% of its assets in cash and U.S. Treasuries, complying with Rule 2a-7.

Several other institutional funds are also contributing to this burgeoning market. BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund is nearing $2.20 billion, while WisdomTree’s Government Money Market Digital Fund has reached approximately $832.3 million, marking a 40% increase over the past month. Other funds, including Franklin Templeton’s on-chain U.S. government money fund and Ondo’s short-term government bond fund, are also adding to the total, with values of $752.3 million and $729.6 million, respectively.

To reach the $10 billion target by year-end, the market requires about $2.58 billion in net additions from the current $7.42 billion base. This translates to roughly $700 million in monthly growth through December. Given that total U.S. money market fund assets were reported at $7.26 trillion as of early September, even a small reallocation into tokenized Treasury funds could meet or exceed this target. For instance, a one-basis-point shift could yield approximately $726 million, while three basis points could potentially bring in about $2.18 billion.

The current yield environment is also favorable for these tokenized funds. As of September 10, three-month Treasury bill rates were at 3.94%, which is shaping the income potential for tokenized investments and increasing the demand for “on-chain dollars with yield.” The recent Dencun upgrade has improved Ethereum’s EIP-4844, resulting in lower data availability fees for rollups, thereby reducing friction for minting, transferring, and redeeming tokens on Layer 2 solutions where many real-world asset tokens are traded.

The distribution of these tokenized assets is crucial. Circle’s USDC smart contract allows for near-instant redemptions into stablecoins, enhancing liquidity. Additionally, USYC is now positioned as yield-bearing collateral for Binance’s institutional clients, expanding its utility beyond mere trading assets.

Looking ahead, a base-case scenario suggests that if the group of funds around BUIDL, WTGXX, BENJI, OUSG, and USYC grows by 8% to 10% over the next few months, it could contribute an additional $600 million to $800 million. This growth, combined with Fidelity's new OnChain Class and potential new entrants, could help meet the remaining gap to reach the $10 billion target.

However, if the market experiences a slowdown due to declining yields or hesitance from buyers, projections could drop to a lower range of $9.1 billion to $9.6 billion. Nevertheless, the infrastructure for these tokenized funds continues to strengthen, as Fidelity's OnChain Class adheres to money market rules while also recording ownership on-chain, laying the groundwork for future issuances.

The Ethereum network is also consolidating its position as a preferred platform for these transactions. RWA.xyz's product listings indicate that many of the top tokenized vehicles are available on Ethereum, with several also bridged to Layer 2 solutions. This positioning, along with improved collateral integrations and stablecoin redemption options, channels more volume into Ethereum, even as activity increasingly shifts to lower-cost rollups.

As we approach December, key indicators to watch include the number of on-chain holders, net minting activity on RWA.xyz’s tracker, new SEC filings for additional OnChain classes, and fresh custody arrangements that will enable institutions to hold these tokens securely. If net minting can maintain a pace of $600 million to $800 million monthly, the market is well on track to achieve the $10 billion milestone on Ethereum before year-end.
