BitMine Immersion Technologies has significantly expanded its Ethereum holdings, now owning roughly 1.5% of the total supply, valued at over $8 billion. This move underscores increasing corporate interest in Ethereum as a key digital asset.

Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, currently has approximately 120.7 million coins in circulation. BitMine, a Las Vegas-based firm, initiated its Ethereum treasury strategy in late June and recently purchased an additional 153,000 ETH, bringing its total holdings to about 1.86 million ETH. This purchase, worth around $655 million, marks a substantial step toward BitMine’s goal of owning 5% of Ethereum’s supply.

According to data from CoinGecko and Strategic Ethereum Reserve, BitMine is now the largest corporate holder of Ethereum, surpassing other treasury holders such as SharpLink Gaming, The Ether Machine, and even the Ethereum Foundation, a non-profit organization.

In a video shared on Monday, Tom Lee, co-founder of Fundstrat and chair of BitMine’s board, likened Ethereum’s current phase to a “1971 moment.” He referenced the year when the US government abandoned the gold standard, which led to a boom in financial innovation, including the creation of money market funds and debit cards. Lee suggested that the next decade could see widespread adoption of stablecoins and tokenized equities, accelerated by legislative developments like the GENIUS Act passed this summer. He also speculated that advancements in artificial intelligence could integrate with blockchain technology, further boosting Ethereum’s relevance.

Lee emphasized that as the world becomes increasingly digital, Bitcoin will serve as a digital store of value, while Ethereum is poised to become the platform for digital assets and decentralized financial infrastructure, with significant interest from Wall Street.

Besides Ethereum, BitMine also holds Bitcoin, owning 192 BTC valued at approximately $21 million as of Monday. Despite these sizable crypto holdings, BitMine’s stock price fell 3.5% to $42.11 on Monday. Ethereum’s price also dipped slightly by 0.5% to around $4,300, down about 13% from its all-time high just under $5,000 reached late last month.

Historically, Bitcoin has outperformed Ethereum, but both saw heightened popularity during the pandemic-era crypto boom. The ETH/BTC exchange ratio peaked in November 2021 at about 0.085 but dropped to a multi-year low of 0.018 in April. As of Monday, the ratio stood at 0.038, still below the eight-year average of 0.047. Lee noted that if Bitcoin were to reach $250,000, Ethereum’s price could correspondingly rise to $12,000, assuming the long-term average ratio holds.

Lee concluded that Ethereum is likely to not only recover to its historical average relative to Bitcoin but potentially surpass it, driven by its role as the blockchain of choice for financial systems and AI applications.

Market context: Ethereum’s recent price correction follows a strong rally that brought it close to $5,000, reflecting broader volatility in the crypto market. BitMine’s aggressive accumulation of ETH highlights growing institutional confidence in Ethereum’s long-term potential, even amid short-term price fluctuations.

In summary, BitMine’s substantial Ethereum purchase and strategic vision signal a deepening institutional commitment to Ethereum as a foundational digital asset for future financial innovation.
