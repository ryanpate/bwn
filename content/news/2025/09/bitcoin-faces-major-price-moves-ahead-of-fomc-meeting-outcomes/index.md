Bitcoin is currently positioned at a critical juncture ahead of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting scheduled for September 17. Trading at $115,046.29, Bitcoin is at the upper edge of its $108,000-$116,000 air gap range, and the outcome of the FOMC meeting is expected to significantly influence its price direction. The cryptocurrency has seen a slight decline of 0.2% in the past 24 hours, and market participants are closely monitoring the Federal Reserve's policy messaging for cues on future price movements.

The FOMC meeting is crucial for Bitcoin as it could determine whether the cryptocurrency breaks through the $116,000 resistance level or retests the $107,500 support. According to a report from Bitfinex Alpha, a sustained break above $116,000 would indicate renewed momentum for Bitcoin, potentially leading to higher price targets. Conversely, if Bitcoin fails to surpass this resistance, it may face downward pressure, testing the lower support levels.

On-chain data indicates that short-term holders are realizing significant profits, totaling $189 million daily. This profit-taking could create additional selling pressure, particularly if the Federal Reserve's signals are perceived as disappointing. The report emphasizes that Bitcoin's current position at the resistance level makes the FOMC outcome particularly consequential for its short-term trajectory.

Market analysts, including MEXC chief analyst Shawn Young, predict extreme volatility in the wake of the FOMC meeting. Young notes that a dovish outlook from the Fed, signaling aggressive easing, could propel Bitcoin toward the $120,000-$125,000 range as capital shifts from bonds to riskier assets. However, if the Fed adopts a more cautious stance regarding future rate cuts, it may lead to the unwinding of leveraged positions and a retest of support levels around $107,000-$108,000.

The current economic backdrop complicates predictions for Bitcoin's price movement. Sygnum Bank's Head of Investments, Fabian Dori, highlights conflicting signals from the labor market and inflation rates. While signs of weakness in the labor market could support rate cuts, persistent inflation near 3% and a resurgence in business activity may lead the Fed to exercise caution.

The air gap range represents a critical point for Bitcoin, which must overcome resistance created by supply redistribution since the highs in August. VALR CEO Farzam Ehsani emphasizes that sustained monetary easing is necessary for Bitcoin to challenge the $120,000 to $125,000 levels. Without sufficient liquidity support, Bitcoin could face retests of lower levels, such as $100,000-$105,000.

Institutional interest in Bitcoin is evident, with ETF inflows totaling $2.3 billion last week, showcasing positioning ahead of the FOMC decision. However, Bitcoin's performance has lagged behind gold and equities, indicating a cautious sentiment among investors until clearer easing trajectories from the Fed emerge.

As the market braces for potential volatility, Bitcoin's direction will hinge on whether policymakers indicate a preference for aggressive accommodation or a more measured approach in the coming months. The outcome of the FOMC meeting will be pivotal in determining Bitcoin's next moves.

In summary, Bitcoin's price movements are closely tied to the Federal Reserve's policy decisions, with significant implications for traders and investors alike.
