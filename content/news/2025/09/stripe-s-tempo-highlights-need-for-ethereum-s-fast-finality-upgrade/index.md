### TL;DR
- Stripe's Tempo is built as a new Layer 1 instead of an Ethereum Layer 2.
- Ethereum's finality currently takes 12-15 minutes, while fast finality aims for 2 seconds.
- Ethereum developers are working to reduce block intervals from 12 to 6 seconds.
- Fast confirmation rules could allow transactions to be confirmed in 10-30 seconds.
- Critics warn that 2-3 years for upgrades is a long time in the fast-paced crypto market.

In a recent discussion about the future of blockchain technology, Matt Huang from Paradigm highlighted the importance of fast finality in the context of Stripe's new Layer 1 blockchain, Tempo. This move has sparked conversations within the Ethereum community about the necessity of improving transaction speeds to meet market demands.

Fast finality refers to the assurance that once a transaction is confirmed on a blockchain, it is irreversible and secure from any network disruptions. Currently, Ethereum's transaction finality can take 12 to 15 minutes due to its Proof-of-Stake mechanism, which requires multiple attestations from validators. While this system has been effective, the increasing demand for quicker transaction confirmations has led to calls for enhancements.

Stripe's decision to develop Tempo as a new Layer 1 blockchain rather than an Ethereum Layer 2 solution has drawn attention to Ethereum's slower finality times. Huang noted that while some aspects of fast finality could technically be achieved on Layer 2, the limitations of Layer 2 solutions are tied to the underlying Layer 1 technology. As a result, the Ethereum community is recognizing the critical need to prioritize speed in order to remain competitive in the evolving landscape of global payment infrastructure.

Ethereum's roadmap has long included plans for fast finality, but there is a growing urgency among community members to accelerate these developments. Barnabe Monnot from the Ethereum Foundation shared updates on initiatives aimed at achieving faster finality. These include:

- Reducing block intervals from 12 seconds to 6 seconds, with successful tests already completed.
- Implementing a new "fast confirmation rule" that would allow transactions to be confirmed in just 1 to 3 blocks, equating to a confirmation time of 10 to 30 seconds.
- Exploring core protocol improvements and next-generation consensus mechanisms, such as three-slot finality, to enhance overall transaction speeds.

The proposed timeline for these upgrades includes fast confirmation rules being implemented within 3 to 6 months, shortened block intervals through a hard fork in about a year, and further core enhancements in 1.5 to 2 years. However, critics have pointed out that 2 to 3 years is a significant duration in the rapidly changing crypto market, where specialized chains could potentially gain traction in the payments and institutional settlement sectors.

The urgency for Ethereum to enhance its transaction speeds is underscored by the competitive landscape. While Ethereum has established itself as a robust global public infrastructure, the need for speed is becoming increasingly critical. If Ethereum can successfully combine fast finality with its existing strengths in decentralization, it may prevent its network from being sidelined by faster alternatives.

In conclusion, the discussions surrounding Stripe's Tempo and the push for fast finality highlight the importance of adapting to market demands. As Ethereum works towards these upgrades, it must balance the need for speed with its commitment to decentralization to maintain its position as a leading blockchain solution.

Takeaway: The push for fast finality in Ethereum is essential to meet the growing demands of the crypto market, especially in payment processing.
