This morning, a group of 12 Senate Democrats introduced a six-page framework aimed at establishing a digital asset market structure. Their proposal seeks to balance the need to combat illicit finance with the imperative of protecting users' financial privacy. Notable members of this group include Senate Banking ranking member Ruben Gallego (AZ), Kirsten Gillibrand (NY), and Catherine Cortez Masto (NV).

The framework outlines several guiding principles for digital assets legislation, emphasizing the importance of safeguarding financial privacy while simultaneously restricting access for bad actors to the financial system. The document's first page articulates these dual goals, setting the stage for the more detailed proposals that follow.

Among the key points, the framework suggests that digital asset platforms should be required to register with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) as "financial institutions" under the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA). This registration would entail adopting anti-money laundering (AML) and combating the financing of terrorism (CFT) policies. The framework also addresses the concern of bad actors utilizing decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms to bypass existing illicit finance controls. Furthermore, it insists that crypto platforms serving U.S. customers must comply with sanctions and AML/CFT requirements, regardless of their domicile. A notable aspect of the proposal is the intention to shape ecosystems that isolate non-compliant platforms that facilitate illicit activities.

However, the framework has drawn criticism for its lack of specificity, particularly regarding the implementation of its proposals. Questions remain about what it means to "address bad actors' use of DeFi platforms" and the role U.S. regulators would play in "shaping ecosystems" to exclude non-compliant entities. This vagueness is particularly concerning given that the framework is less detailed than the recently released draft of the CLARITY Act by the Senate Banking Committee.

Former CFTC Chair Tim Massad has expressed support for a regulatory scheme that could potentially involve a digital ID system to allow only "good actors" to transact. While this idea may be theoretically appealing, its practical implementation, especially for Bitcoin, poses significant technical challenges. In contrast, smart contract blockchain networks could be more vulnerable to government mandates that enforce specific rules within their code to prevent transactions by bad actors.

To foster trust among Bitcoin and crypto advocates, the Democrats should consider providing clearer definitions and more detailed explanations of their intentions regarding financial privacy and illicit finance. The framework's current language raises questions about what constitutes a "platform"—whether it refers solely to centralized entities like Coinbase or Kraken, or also includes decentralized services such as Samourai Wallet or Tornado Cash. These clarifications are essential for ensuring that the rights of Bitcoin and crypto users to maintain their privacy are enshrined in law.

In summary, while the proposed framework aims to address critical issues in the digital asset space, its ambiguity could hinder trust and cooperation from the crypto community. The need for more precise language and detailed explanations is evident as the conversation around crypto regulation continues to evolve.

Market context: As discussions on crypto regulation gain traction, the implications of such frameworks could significantly influence market dynamics and user engagement within the digital asset ecosystem.

Takeaway: The Democrats' new crypto framework raises important questions about financial privacy and regulatory clarity in the digital asset space.
