Subscribe No spam • Unsubscribe anytime • 100% free The intersection of Pokémon cards and blockchain technology is gaining momentum, with various platforms emerging to tokenize these collectibles. This trend offers significant advantages over traditional trading, such as increased liquidity and transparency. As highlighted by Bitwise\u0026rsquo;s Danny Nelson, the Pokémon card market is valued in the billions but has largely remained informal and offchain. The introduction of tokenization is changing this landscape, allowing for 24/7 global trading and improved provenance.\nIn the past month, the leading tokenized Pokémon card platforms collectively processed over $120 million in transaction volume. This surge primarily came from digital pack rips, secondary trades, and Gacha games, indicating a growing interest in the crypto space for collectible trading. Courtyard, which has been operational for over two years on the Polygon network, has emerged as a frontrunner in this market. It reported nearly $80 million in transaction volume last month, focusing on Pokémon cards while also supporting sports cards and collectible comics. Courtyard employs a vaulted, physically-backed NFT approach, ensuring that users can trade cards with confidence. Notably, the platform does not require KYC (Know Your Customer) verification, except when redeeming cards for shipment, and it deletes user data after 90 days.\nFollowing closely is Collector Crypt, a newer platform built on Solana that achieved $44 million in volume last month, exclusively dealing in Pokémon cards. Collector Crypt distinguishes itself with a native token, $CARDS, which has quickly reached an $85 million market cap since its recent launch. However, users must provide personal information to withdraw funds, which raises considerations about privacy and security.\nAnother emerging player on Solana is Phygitals, which recorded $2 million in volume in August, marking a 245% increase month-over-month. Phygitals allows users to trade Pokémon cards without needing to deposit funds, as they can connect their existing wallets like Phantom. The platform features a Claw Machine for purchasing random Pokémon packs, with prices ranging from $1 to $500. Additionally, Phygitals is working on an auction system for premium cards, indicating its commitment to expanding user engagement.\nEmporium is also gaining traction, offering a user-friendly experience for trading Pokémon cards. It allows users to buy random PSA 10 graded cards for 60 USDC, providing an option to sell back unwanted cards for 85% of their market value. Like Phygitals, Emporium does not require deposits and uses Privy for account creation, making it accessible for users.\nWhile these platforms dominate the tokenized card scene, new entrants are emerging. RIP.FUN, currently in closed beta, aims to be a hub for onchain Pokémon cards, allowing users to open mystery packs and track sets. Grailed, another Solana-based marketplace, offers secondary card listings and uses its own currency, Gems, for transactions. ToCa introduces a prize pool system backed by graded Pokémon cards, while Beezie supports crosschain payments and offers a marketplace for various collectibles.\nThe rapid growth of these platforms indicates a significant shift in how collectibles are traded and valued in the digital age. As tokenization continues to evolve, it presents new opportunities for collectors and investors alike. The integration of blockchain technology into the Pokémon card market not only enhances liquidity but also provides a transparent and efficient trading environment.\nIn conclusion, the rise of tokenized Pokémon card platforms reflects a broader trend in the crypto space, where traditional collectibles are being reimagined through technology. This shift could redefine the collectibles market, making it more accessible and engaging for a new generation of enthusiasts.\nSources: https://www.bankless.com/read/the-top-tokenized-pokemon-card-platforms\nSee also: How to store Bitcoin safely\nSee also: What is DeFi?\nSecure your crypto Protect your assets with a hardware wallet.

Subscribe No spam • Unsubscribe anytime • 100% free Forward Industries has made headlines with its announcement of a $1.65 billion private placement in public equity (PIPE) aimed at bolstering its treasury strategy centered on Solana. This move marks a significant pivot for the company, which has traditionally focused on designing products for medical and technology sectors. The announcement was made on Monday, and it has already had a notable impact on the company\u0026rsquo;s stock performance.\nIn the wake of the announcement, Forward Industries (ticker: FORD) experienced a dramatic surge in its stock price, soaring by 92% during pre-market trading to reach $31.50. However, as the market opened, the stock adjusted to around $28.61, still reflecting a 75% increase. As of the latest updates, FORD is trading at approximately $22.95, which represents a 40% increase on the day. This volatility highlights the market\u0026rsquo;s reaction to the company\u0026rsquo;s new direction.\nThe PIPE will be led by Kyle Samani, co-founder and managing partner of Multicoin Capital, who will assume the role of chair of Forward Industries\u0026rsquo; board once the PIPE closes. Multicoin Capital has been an active investor in the Solana ecosystem since its inception in May 2018. In addition to Multicoin, Forward will receive strategic support from notable institutional crypto firms, including Galaxy Digital and Jump Crypto, which will assist with advisory and risk management services, as well as infrastructure for trading, lending, and staking.\nIf Forward Industries were to invest the entirety of its PIPE proceeds into Solana, it would position itself among the largest treasury firms dedicated to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Currently, three publicly traded firms hold more than $1.65 billion worth of Ethereum, while eight firms hold similar amounts of Bitcoin. Among firms focusing on Solana, Forward would become the largest if it allocated roughly a quarter of its PIPE proceeds to the digital asset.\nAs of August 4, another Solana treasury firm, Upexi, held over 2 million Solana tokens, while DeFi Development Corp. owned over 2 million as well, valued at approximately $434 million based on current market prices. This trend of traditional firms pivoting towards cryptocurrency is becoming more prevalent, with some companies abandoning their previous business models to become proxies for their chosen digital assets.\nDespite this shift, Forward Industries will continue to engage in its original focus on technology and medical products, according to sources familiar with the matter. The firm’s partnership with Galaxy Digital is particularly noteworthy, as Galaxy recently increased its exposure to Solana by swapping $100 million in Ethereum for Solana. Jump Crypto is also making strides in the Solana space, having begun development on a new validator client called Firedancer, with a prototype released last year.\nOn the same day as Forward\u0026rsquo;s announcement, Solana\u0026rsquo;s price was around $214, reflecting a 5.2% increase in the past 24 hours. This performance aligns with other altcoins, including XRP, which also saw a similar rise. Forward Industries will join a select group of firms focused on Solana treasury management, including SOL Strategies, Sharps Technology, DeFi Development Corp., and Upexi.\nThe PIPE financing route taken by Forward is reminiscent of Upexi\u0026rsquo;s earlier strategy, which saw its share price drop significantly after a registration-of-shares filing was approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, allowing PIPE investors to sell their shares. This context underscores the risks and opportunities associated with such financial maneuvers in the evolving landscape of cryptocurrency.\nIn summary, Forward Industries\u0026rsquo; strategic pivot towards Solana through a substantial PIPE investment highlights the growing intersection of traditional business models and the cryptocurrency market, potentially reshaping its future and that of its investors.\nSee also: How to store Bitcoin safely\nSee also: What is DeFi?\nSources Forward Industries Stock Soars Following $1.65 Billion Solana Treasury Pivot — https://decrypt.co/338475/forward-industries-stock-soars-1-65-billion-solana-pivot Secure your crypto Protect your assets with a hardware wallet.

Subscribe No spam • Unsubscribe anytime • 100% free Hyperliquid\u0026rsquo;s governance token, HYPE, has experienced a significant surge, climbing above $50 during Asian trading hours. This increase, which saw the token gain more than 7% in the last 24 hours to reach $50.08, is attributed to the heightened interest surrounding Hyperliquid\u0026rsquo;s proposed stablecoin, USDH. The token\u0026rsquo;s rise is nearing its August peak of $51, reflecting growing confidence in Hyperliquid\u0026rsquo;s strategy for USDH, which has attracted attention from established players in the stablecoin market.\nIn the context of the ongoing competition for control over USDH, two prominent entities, Paxos and Agora, have submitted their proposals, each with distinct strategies aimed at managing the stablecoin. Paxos, a well-known stablecoin operator, entered the race with a proposal led by its new division, Paxos Labs, which was formed in June. This proposal emphasizes compliance with stablecoin regulatory frameworks in both Europe and the United States. Paxos plans to deploy USDH directly on Hyperliquid\u0026rsquo;s two chains, HyperEVM and HyperCore, and has committed to holding high-quality reserves, including T-Bills and Repos.\nPaxos\u0026rsquo;s proposal is notable for its aggressive revenue-sharing model, which promises that 95% of the interest generated from USDH reserves will be directed towards buying back HYPE tokens. This buyback strategy is intended to benefit ecosystem partners and users, enhancing the overall value proposition of HYPE. Additionally, Paxos has pledged to list HYPE across its extensive brokerage infrastructure, which supports trading on platforms such as PayPal, Venmo, MercadoLibre, Nubank, and Interactive Brokers. Bhaumik Kotecha, co-founder of Paxos Labs, highlighted the importance of keeping USDH infrastructure open to developers and payment providers, aiming to maximize liquidity and cost efficiency across various applications.\nOn the other hand, Agora, known for its issuance of the VanEck-backed AUSD, has also submitted a competing proposal for USDH. Agora\u0026rsquo;s approach involves forming a coalition with partners like Rain for card and fiat coverage, LayerZero for cross-chain interoperability, and Moonpay for retail access at launch. The company has committed to returning all net revenue from USDH operations back to Hyperliquid, either through its Assistance Fund or by purchasing HYPE on the open market. Nick van Eck, Agora\u0026rsquo;s CEO, emphasized that USDH would be a native asset to Hyperliquid, rather than a repurposed asset from another ecosystem. He also described Agora as a neutral issuer, without its own chain or brokerage, ensuring that it would not compete with its partners.\nThe competition for USDH control between Paxos and Agora highlights the evolving landscape of stablecoins and decentralized finance (DeFi). Both proposals aim to enhance liquidity and accessibility, which are critical factors for the success of any stablecoin in the market. As these developments unfold, they could have significant implications for users, markets, and regulatory frameworks in the crypto space.\nMarket context indicates that the interest in stablecoins continues to grow, with both institutional and retail investors seeking reliable options for digital transactions. The competition between Paxos and Agora may lead to innovations that could benefit users and enhance the overall stability of the crypto ecosystem.\nIn summary, Hyperliquid\u0026rsquo;s HYPE token has surged past $50 amid an intense competition for the proposed stablecoin USDH, with Paxos and Agora presenting distinct strategies that could reshape the landscape of decentralized finance.\nSources: https://cryptoslate.com/hyperliquids-hype-token-surges-past-50-amid-stablecoin-proposal-competition/\nSee also: What is DeFi?\nSee also: How to store Bitcoin safely\nSecure your crypto Protect your assets with a hardware wallet.

Subscribe No spam • Unsubscribe anytime • 100% free In recent weeks, the tech industry has witnessed significant developments, particularly in the realms of artificial intelligence and acquisitions. Notably, Atlassian\u0026rsquo;s acquisition of The Browser Company for $610 million has sparked discussions about the value of AI-driven technologies in web browsing. This acquisition is particularly striking given that The Browser Company generates less than $10 million in annual revenue, raising questions about the valuation of AI-related startups amidst the current hype surrounding the technology.\nThe Browser Company, known for its product Dia, aims to redefine the web browsing experience by integrating AI capabilities. Founder Josh Miller has stated that the acquisition will allow the company to operate independently while leveraging Atlassian\u0026rsquo;s resources to enhance distribution and monetization strategies. However, some industry observers remain skeptical about the immediate benefits of AI browsers, suggesting that the $610 million price tag may reflect inflated expectations rather than tangible advancements in user experience.\nIn another notable event, Meta Platforms has experienced a wave of executive resignations just two weeks after launching its Meta Superintelligence Labs (MSL). Six key engineers and executives, including some with over a decade of experience at Meta, have left the company, which has raised concerns about internal dynamics and confidence in the company\u0026rsquo;s ambitious AI goals. Although some analysts suggest this may negatively impact Meta\u0026rsquo;s stock, others believe that CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u0026rsquo;s track record and strategic vision will ultimately prevail, leading to successful developments in AI.\nOpenAI has also made headlines with its acquisition of Statsig for $1.1 billion, marking a significant investment in talent acquisition. The move is seen as part of OpenAI\u0026rsquo;s strategy to strengthen its capabilities in AI applications, particularly following the lukewarm reception of its GPT-5 launch. The new CTO of Applications, Vijay Raji, previously worked at Meta and is expected to play a crucial role in shaping OpenAI\u0026rsquo;s future direction.\nMeanwhile, Anthropic, an AI model producer, has raised $13 billion in a Series F funding round, bringing its valuation to approximately $183 billion. This dramatic increase from just $4 billion a year ago highlights the growing interest and investment in AI technologies, despite ongoing debates about the sustainability of such high valuations in the tech sector.\nIn a significant partnership, Apple has announced an exclusive collaboration with Google to integrate the AI model Gemini into its Siri platform. This development aims to enhance Siri\u0026rsquo;s capabilities while ensuring user data remains private and secure. The partnership aligns with Apple\u0026rsquo;s commitment to localized AI models, which may pave the way for personalized AI experiences for users.\nOverall, these developments underscore the rapid evolution of the tech landscape, particularly in AI and its applications across various platforms. As companies navigate the challenges and opportunities presented by these technologies, the impact on users, markets, and regulatory frameworks will continue to unfold.\nIn conclusion, the tech industry remains dynamic, with substantial investments and strategic partnerships shaping the future of AI and its integration into everyday tools and applications.\nSee also: What is DeFi?\nSee also: How to store Bitcoin safely\nSources Limitless High Five: AI Browsers \u0026amp; Billion-Dollar Hires — https://www.bankless.com/read/limitless-high-five-ai-browsers-billion-dollar-hires Secure your crypto Protect your assets with a hardware wallet.

Subscribe No spam • Unsubscribe anytime • 100% free In recent months, Bitcoin and Ethereum have reached new all-time highs, while Dogecoin, once a darling of the crypto community, has not shared in this success. Currently, Dogecoin is valued at just over $0.21, significantly below its peak of $0.73 in 2021, representing a decline of 70%. This stark contrast raises questions about why Dogecoin is lagging behind other cryptocurrencies despite the overall positive sentiment in the market.\nDogecoin, created as a joke, gained popularity largely due to its strong community and endorsements from high-profile figures like Elon Musk. The digital asset saw a notable rebound last fall as Musk campaigned alongside former President Trump, and its price peaked at around $0.48 in December 2021. However, since then, it has struggled to maintain momentum, failing to surpass the $0.40 mark since January 2022.\nExperts suggest that the primary reason for Dogecoin\u0026rsquo;s underperformance is its lack of practical use cases compared to other cryptocurrencies. Douglas Colkitt, founder of Ambient Finance, noted that while Dogecoin thrives on community vibes, it lacks structural demand drivers that support its value. Unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum, which have established roles as stores of value and platforms for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, Dogecoin does not anchor DeFi collateral or offer staking yields.\nGrayscale\u0026rsquo;s Head of Research, Zach Pandl, further emphasized that institutional investors are focusing on digital assets with real-world applications. While meme coins like Dogecoin have their place in the market, they are not attracting the same level of interest from serious investors looking for revenue-generating projects. Bitcoin is viewed as a long-term store of value, while Ethereum is recognized for its utility in creating stablecoins and other applications.\nDespite the current challenges, there is still potential demand for Dogecoin. Analysts have indicated that the approval of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) linked to Dogecoin could provide a boost. However, the coin\u0026rsquo;s origins as a meme mean that its value is often perceived as speculative and tied to internet culture rather than fundamental utility.\nHistorically, Dogecoin has been framed as a viable payment option due to its low price per coin, making it accessible for everyday transactions. However, it has not gained traction in this area, and many view it as more of a fun asset rather than a serious investment. Jeff Dorman, CIO of Arca, pointed out that 75% of tokens observed by his firm have shown negative returns this year, with only those linked to genuine business models, like Bitcoin and Ethereum, experiencing price increases.\nLooking ahead, developments such as DogeOS, which aims to bring applications and games to the Dogecoin network, and the potential launch of Dogecoin ETFs by firms like Grayscale and Bitwise could influence its market position. However, experts remain skeptical about whether these initiatives will lead to lasting value for Dogecoin. Colkitt remarked that while a DOGE ETF might generate initial excitement and inflows, it would also represent a broader acceptance of absurdity in financial markets. The ongoing demand for Dogecoin is largely driven by its meme status, and as long as investors are willing to engage with it for nostalgic reasons, there will be some level of interest.\nIn conclusion, while Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to thrive, Dogecoin\u0026rsquo;s future remains uncertain due to its lack of utility and dependence on community sentiment. The market will be watching closely to see if upcoming developments can revitalize interest in this once-popular meme coin.\nSee also: How to store Bitcoin safely\nSee also: What is DeFi?\nSources Bitcoin and Ethereum Hit New Highs—Why Not Dogecoin? — https://decrypt.co/338172/bitcoin-ethereum-hit-new-highs-why-not-dogecoin Secure your crypto Protect your assets with a hardware wallet.

Subscribe No spam • Unsubscribe anytime • 100% free A recent discussion on social media highlighted an intriguing perspective on cryptocurrency assets, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum. The conversation revolved around the idea of coordinating around a single asset to leverage its value for loans, humorously referred to as an \u0026lsquo;infinite money glitch.\u0026rsquo; This notion sparked various responses, with some asserting that Bitcoin embodies this concept as the first asset created by the people, for the people. However, the discussion also drew attention to Ethereum, positioning it not merely as an asset but as a broader project that holds significant promise for humanity.\nEthereum is often described as more than just a blockchain or a cryptocurrency; it is perceived as a project that facilitates coordination among people. Proponents argue that Ethereum represents a collective effort to build economically valuable code that can be passed down through generations. This vision extends beyond mere financial transactions to encompass a transformative potential for global peace, wealth, and happiness. Advocates believe that if humanity can unite around Ethereum as a neutral financial foundation, it could lead to unprecedented progress.\nThe belief in Ethereum\u0026rsquo;s potential is framed as a long-term endeavor, suggesting that the benefits of this project will not materialize in a few years but rather over decades. The argument posits that the creation of numerous effective smart contracts will yield significant second and third-order effects, contributing to the overarching goal of human coordination. However, the path is not without challenges. While some embrace the vision of Ethereum as a collective project, others appear to focus on dismantling its structure for personal gain. This phenomenon, referred to as Ethereum unbundling, reflects a political disposition within the community.\nCritics of Ethereum\u0026rsquo;s vision often draw parallels to Bitcoin\u0026rsquo;s staunch supporters, suggesting that both groups share distinct ideological traits. Just as Bitcoin advocates adhere to principles of Austrian economics and individualism, Ethereum unbundlers may exhibit similar tendencies. This divergence raises questions about the community\u0026rsquo;s cohesion and the future trajectory of the Ethereum project.\nThe discussion around Ethereum also highlights a fundamental difference in how it is perceived compared to Bitcoin. While Bitcoin is often seen as a unique asset with a capped supply of 21 million coins, Ethereum is characterized by its ongoing nature as a project dedicated to fostering open-source contributions. This distinction positions Ethereum as a \u0026lsquo;special snowflake\u0026rsquo; in its own right, representing a continuous effort to develop the most effective coordination software for humanity.\nIn terms of market context, Ethereum\u0026rsquo;s role as a foundational layer for decentralized applications and finance continues to evolve. Its potential for innovation and collaboration remains a focal point for developers and users alike. As the crypto landscape matures, the dialogue surrounding Ethereum\u0026rsquo;s purpose and impact will likely persist, influencing both its adoption and the broader market.\nIn summary, the conversation about Ethereum encapsulates a vision of collective human progress through coordination and open-source development. While challenges exist, the belief in Ethereum as a project for humanity\u0026rsquo;s future continues to inspire many within the crypto community.\nSee also: What is DeFi?\nSee also: How to store Bitcoin safely\nSources Ethereum is the Project — https://www.bankless.com/read/ethereum-is-the-project Secure your crypto Protect your assets with a hardware wallet.

Subscribe No spam • Unsubscribe anytime • 100% free Michael Saylor\u0026rsquo;s company, Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), recently faced a notable setback when it was not included in the S\u0026amp;P 500 index, despite meeting all established criteria. This decision has drawn attention to the opaque nature of the selection process, especially as the commission-free trading app Robinhood was unexpectedly added to the index, resulting in a 7% increase in its stock price. The incident has raised questions about the criteria used by the S\u0026amp;P 500\u0026rsquo;s secret committee and the implications for companies heavily invested in cryptocurrency.\nThe S\u0026amp;P 500 is widely regarded as a benchmark for corporate prestige in the United States, serving as a key indicator of the health of the economy. Companies strive to be included in this exclusive group, which is perceived as a mark of success and stability. Strategy, which has a significant Bitcoin holding, checked all the necessary boxes for inclusion: it has a strong market capitalization, sufficient liquidity, and has reported four consecutive quarters of positive earnings. Many investors had anticipated that its substantial Bitcoin assets, now totaling over 636,000 BTC, would secure its place in the index.\nHowever, the decision to exclude Strategy highlights the discretionary nature of the S\u0026amp;P 500\u0026rsquo;s selection process. According to Eric Balchunas, an analyst at Bloomberg ETF, meeting the established criteria is not a guarantee of inclusion. He pointed out that the selection is ultimately determined by a \u0026lsquo;Committee\u0026rsquo; composed of senior analysts from S\u0026amp;P Dow Jones Indices, whose identities remain undisclosed to prevent lobbying and external influence. This lack of transparency has led to frustrations among investors who believe that the committee\u0026rsquo;s decisions are not based solely on objective metrics.\nThe contrast between Strategy\u0026rsquo;s exclusion and Robinhood\u0026rsquo;s inclusion has sparked debate within the investment community. Critics have noted that a company with a questionable product, such as one that sells a cryptocurrency called \u0026lsquo;Fartcoin,\u0026rsquo; was admitted while Strategy, a company focused solely on Bitcoin, was not. This has fueled speculation that biases against cryptocurrency companies may still exist within the traditional financial establishment.\nThe reasons behind Strategy\u0026rsquo;s exclusion remain unclear, as there is no official explanation provided by the S\u0026amp;P 500 committee. Historical precedents, such as the delays experienced by Tesla before its eventual inclusion, suggest that the committee\u0026rsquo;s decision-making process can be unpredictable. Balchunas has called for greater transparency, suggesting that a list of companies delayed in their entrance to the S\u0026amp;P 500 would reveal patterns that could benefit investors.\nStrategy\u0026rsquo;s reliance on Bitcoin as a core component of its treasury and market value is unprecedented among publicly traded companies. This unique positioning may have raised concerns among traditional committee members regarding the volatility associated with Bitcoin. Since the price of MSTR shares closely follows Bitcoin\u0026rsquo;s price movements, including it in the S\u0026amp;P 500 could expose the index to greater fluctuations than those typically seen with conventional stocks.\nThe exclusion of Strategy from the S\u0026amp;P 500 means that index funds tracking the S\u0026amp;P 500 will not be required to purchase its shares. This limitation restricts the automatic flow of capital into Strategy\u0026rsquo;s stock and keeps Bitcoin exposure out of the default retirement portfolios of millions of investors. The event has illuminated the S\u0026amp;P 500\u0026rsquo;s true nature, revealing that it is more actively curated than many investors realize and far less transparent than its reputation suggests.\nIn conclusion, the snubbing of Michael Saylor\u0026rsquo;s Strategy by the S\u0026amp;P 500 committee raises important questions about the intersection of traditional finance and the burgeoning cryptocurrency market, as well as the need for greater transparency in index selection processes.\nSee also: What is DeFi?\nSee also: How to store Bitcoin safely\nSources Why was Michael Saylor’s Strategy snubbed by a S\u0026amp;P 500 secret committee? — https://cryptoslate.com/why-was-michael-saylors-strategy-snubbed-by-a-sp-500-secret-committee/ Secure your crypto Protect your assets with a hardware wallet.

Subscribe No spam • Unsubscribe anytime • 100% free Bank of America (BofA) recently released a report discussing the potential of tokenization as a transformative vehicle for financial assets. The report highlights enhanced liquidity as one of the primary advantages of tokenization, which involves converting ownership of real-world assets into digital tokens recorded on a blockchain. This innovation could significantly change how investors access and manage their assets.\nTokenization is not a new concept; it follows a historical lineage that began with mutual funds and has evolved through various investment vehicles such as separately managed accounts, collective investment trusts, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). According to BofA analysts, led by Craig Siegenthaler, tokenization offers several benefits over traditional asset management structures. These include enhanced liquidity, which could enable 24/7 trading and open up secondary markets for previously illiquid private assets. Additionally, tokenization allows for faster and frictionless settlements, eliminating the multi-day delays that are common in today’s financial markets.\nAnother significant advantage of tokenization is fractional ownership, which reduces investment minimums and broadens access to diverse portfolios. The transparency provided by blockchain technology ensures that ownership and transaction records are immutable and publicly accessible. Furthermore, tokenization can lower fees by cutting out intermediaries, and smart contracts can automate essential processes such as dividend payments and voting rights, while also assisting in navigating regulatory requirements and managing private equity capital calls.\nAs of recent data from RWA.xyz, the total value of real-world assets represented on-chain has surpassed $28 billion. This figure underscores the growing interest and potential for tokenization in the financial sector.\nDespite these advantages, BofA cautions that significant hurdles remain before tokenization can achieve widespread adoption. The most pressing challenge is regulatory uncertainty. While current U.S. policymakers have indicated support for tokenization, future administrations may reverse this stance, and many jurisdictions are still in the process of establishing clear regulations.\nCustody risks also pose a concern for investors. If private keys are lost, access to tokenized assets could be compromised, and institutional-grade custody solutions are still in development. On the technological front, vulnerabilities in smart contracts or blockchain platforms could lead to exploitation, and the integration of tokenization with existing legacy financial infrastructure remains a complex challenge due to the reliance of most institutions on traditional systems.\nMoreover, for publicly traded assets, existing U.S. markets already provide deep liquidity, low fees, and strong investor protections, which may make the case for tokenized versions less compelling. As a result, while the potential for tokenization is significant, its path to mainstream acceptance is fraught with challenges.\nIn the broader market context, the rise of tokenization reflects a growing trend towards digital assets and blockchain technology in finance. However, the competition from established markets and the need for regulatory clarity will play a crucial role in determining the future of tokenization.\nIn conclusion, while tokenization offers promising benefits such as enhanced liquidity and broader access to investments, it faces substantial hurdles that must be addressed for it to achieve widespread adoption.\nSee also: What is DeFi?\nSee also: How to store Bitcoin safely\nSources Tokenization Offers ‘Enhanced Liquidity,’ but Faces Major Hurdles, BofA Says — https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/09/06/tokenization-offers-enhanced-liquidity-but-faces-major-hurdles-bofa-says Secure your crypto Protect your assets with a hardware wallet.

Tokenized Pokémon cards have generated over half a billion in sales volume. Crypto platforms offer lower fees and instant buybacks compared to traditional markets.

Subscribe No spam • Unsubscribe anytime • 100% free The Pokémon franchise, recognized as the highest-grossing media franchise globally, is set to celebrate its 30th anniversary next year. With total revenue surpassing $100 billion, the franchise continues to thrive through the introduction of new creatures, games, and merchandise. Central to its success is the Pokémon Trading Card Game (TCG), which has released over 34,000 unique cards in English alone. These cards are distributed in generation sets every two years, creating a sense of scarcity that fuels collector demand and drives up secondary market prices. In 2025, average annual returns from TCG collectibles reached 46%, outpacing even major tech companies like Nvidia. Recently, the TCG collectible market has seen a significant influx of interest from the crypto sector, with platforms like Courtyard, Collector Crypt, and Phygitals generating over half a billion dollars in sales volume through tokenized secondary markets and gacha-style blind pack openings.\nThe recent launch of Collector Crypt\u0026rsquo;s $CARDS token has intensified discussions about the intersection of Pokémon and crypto. In just three days, the token experienced a tenfold increase, achieving a fully diluted valuation of $450 million, although only 20% of its supply was circulating at that time. Other collectible tokens, such as $ZARD, $MAGIK, and $TCG, also saw substantial gains during this period, although many of these increases have since receded. The platforms typically offer three main options for users: purchasing tokenized cards to redeem for physical cards, buying tokenized cards for resale, or engaging in gacha boxes to obtain rare cards. The latter has proven particularly popular, reflecting a broader trend of gambling-like behavior within the crypto market.\nThe appeal of crypto to Pokémon collectors stems from several potential advantages. One claim is that crypto platforms offer lower fees compared to traditional marketplaces like eBay and TCGPlayer, which can charge up to 13%. Blockchain-based platforms can provide fees that are 2-3 times lower. Additionally, these platforms may offer \u0026lsquo;programmability,\u0026rsquo; such as giving users a percentage of fees when their sold packs are resold. However, there is skepticism about whether these blockchain-based trust guarantees will resonate with existing collectors, many of whom are accustomed to established vendor profiles on traditional sites.\nAnother claim is that crypto enables borrowing and lending against collectibles, a concept referred to as \u0026lsquo;TCGfi.\u0026rsquo; This innovation could appeal to collectors who wish to realize value from their assets without selling them, especially given the Pokémon market\u0026rsquo;s size of approximately $6-7 billion. Instant buyback options for opened cards, allowing users to sell their pulls back for around 85% of market value, could also reduce sales friction.\nDespite the enthusiasm surrounding these developments, many long-time Pokémon collectors express skepticism about the sustainability of this trend. Some argue that the current excitement is driven more by speculation than by genuine interest in the collectibles themselves. The ongoing hype may lead to intensified boom-bust cycles within the TCG market, suggesting that this could be another speculative wave rather than a lasting shift in collector behavior. For those unfamiliar with Pokémon, it may be prudent to approach this market cautiously and seek to understand its dynamics before participating.\nWhile current prices for both tokens and cards are high, the relationship between crypto and collectibles is complex. Crypto offers tangible advantages, such as lower fees and instant buybacks, but the majority of Pokémon enthusiasts are motivated by nostalgia and the physical experience of collecting rather than investment gains. As crypto investors enter the space, treating cards as volatile assets to flip, a fundamental mismatch in motivations emerges. This scenario suggests that two distinct communities are navigating the same field, with the current frenzy appearing more like crypto\u0026rsquo;s search for its next trend rather than a true convergence of interests. Although TCGfi presents a solution for collectors wanting liquidity without selling their cards, the evolution of this intersection will likely unfold gradually, marked by cycles of hype and disappointment. The current moment may not signify a breakthrough but rather an initial, chaotic attempt at integrating these two cultures.\nIn summary, the interaction between tokenization and Pokémon collectibles is still in its early stages, with potential benefits and significant skepticism existing on both sides.\nSee also: How to store Bitcoin safely\nSee also: What is DeFi?\nSources Will Tokenization Change Pokémon Forever? — https://www.bankless.com/read/will-tokenization-change-pokemon-forever Secure your crypto Protect your assets with a hardware wallet.

Subscribe No spam • Unsubscribe anytime • 100% free AI firm Showrunner is embarking on an ambitious project to reconstruct 43 minutes of lost footage from Orson Welles’ 1942 film, \u0026ldquo;The Magnificent Ambersons.\u0026rdquo; This effort will utilize a combination of artificial intelligence and traditional filmmaking techniques to create an interpretation of the missing scenes, drawing from archival research and set photos. The project is set to unfold over the next two years, although it is important to note that Showrunner does not hold the rights to the original film, meaning the final product will not be available for commercial release.\nThe original version of \u0026ldquo;The Magnificent Ambersons\u0026rdquo; was edited down from Welles\u0026rsquo; intended 131-minute cut to just 87 minutes by RKO Studios, which also added a new ending against the director\u0026rsquo;s wishes. Welles expressed great frustration over the alterations, stating, \u0026ldquo;They destroyed \u0026lsquo;Ambersons\u0026rsquo; and it destroyed me.\u0026rdquo; The film\u0026rsquo;s negatives were ultimately destroyed to make room in RKO\u0026rsquo;s vault, and a rough cut that had been sent to Welles was lost, leaving cinephiles yearning for what could have been.\nShowrunner\u0026rsquo;s CEO, Edward Saatchi, described the reconstruction as an \u0026ldquo;academic\u0026rdquo; effort, emphasizing that the goal is not to commercialize the 43 minutes but rather to allow them to exist after decades of speculation about the film\u0026rsquo;s original form. Brian Rose, a filmmaker who has previously worked on reconstructing Welles\u0026rsquo; works, will collaborate with Showrunner on this project. Rose has a history of using archival records, voice actors, and animation to approximate Welles’ vision for his films.\nThe new version of the film will incorporate live footage featuring new actors, while AI deepfake technology will be employed to replicate the likenesses of the original cast. This innovative approach raises questions about the future of film restoration and the role of AI in creative processes.\nThe history of \u0026ldquo;The Magnificent Ambersons\u0026rdquo; is marked by the challenges of preserving Welles\u0026rsquo; vision. The film serves as a follow-up to Welles’ acclaimed \u0026ldquo;Citizen Kane,\u0026rdquo; often regarded as one of the greatest films ever made. The loss of the original cut has rendered the film a subject of fascination and a kind of holy grail for film enthusiasts.\nThis is not the first time efforts have been made to restore Welles\u0026rsquo; works posthumously. In 1998, editor Walter Murch used a memo from Welles to create a restored version of \u0026ldquo;Touch of Evil.\u0026rdquo; Additionally, in 2018, Netflix funded the restoration of Welles’ long-lost film \u0026ldquo;The Other Side of the Wind,\u0026rdquo; which had been trapped in legal disputes for years. Furthermore, Welles\u0026rsquo; voice has been digitally recreated using AI for various projects, showcasing the growing intersection of technology and film.\nShowrunner, which positions itself as the \u0026ldquo;Netflix of AI,\u0026rdquo; is focused on generative storytelling. Its platform allows users to create animated show episodes using prompts or photos. Saatchi has described the generative content as a new artistic medium, and the reconstruction of Welles’ missing footage is viewed as a significant step toward the future of storytelling using AI. He noted that while current AI models struggle to maintain narrative coherence beyond short episodes, the technology is evolving rapidly.\nThis reconstruction project not only highlights the ongoing efforts to preserve cinematic history but also raises important discussions about the implications of AI in creative fields. As technology continues to advance, the possibilities for storytelling and film restoration may expand in unforeseen ways.\nIn conclusion, Showrunner\u0026rsquo;s initiative to reconstruct \u0026ldquo;The Magnificent Ambersons\u0026rdquo; represents a blend of nostalgia and innovation, aiming to bring lost cinematic moments back to life through the lens of modern technology.\nSee also: What is DeFi?\nSee also: How to store Bitcoin safely\nSources AI Will Be Used to \u0026lsquo;Reconstruct\u0026rsquo; Lost Orson Welles Film \u0026lsquo;The Magnificent Ambersons\u0026rsquo; — https://decrypt.co/338273/ai-reconstruct-lost-orson-welles-film-magnificent-ambersons Secure your crypto Protect your assets with a hardware wallet.
