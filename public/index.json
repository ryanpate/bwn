Subscribe No spam • Unsubscribe anytime • 100% free Michael Saylor\u0026rsquo;s company, Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), recently faced a notable setback when it was not included in the S\u0026amp;P 500 index, despite meeting all established criteria. This decision has drawn attention to the opaque nature of the selection process, especially as the commission-free trading app Robinhood was unexpectedly added to the index, resulting in a 7% increase in its stock price. The incident has raised questions about the criteria used by the S\u0026amp;P 500\u0026rsquo;s secret committee and the implications for companies heavily invested in cryptocurrency.\nThe S\u0026amp;P 500 is widely regarded as a benchmark for corporate prestige in the United States, serving as a key indicator of the health of the economy. Companies strive to be included in this exclusive group, which is perceived as a mark of success and stability. Strategy, which has a significant Bitcoin holding, checked all the necessary boxes for inclusion: it has a strong market capitalization, sufficient liquidity, and has reported four consecutive quarters of positive earnings. Many investors had anticipated that its substantial Bitcoin assets, now totaling over 636,000 BTC, would secure its place in the index.\nHowever, the decision to exclude Strategy highlights the discretionary nature of the S\u0026amp;P 500\u0026rsquo;s selection process. According to Eric Balchunas, an analyst at Bloomberg ETF, meeting the established criteria is not a guarantee of inclusion. He pointed out that the selection is ultimately determined by a \u0026lsquo;Committee\u0026rsquo; composed of senior analysts from S\u0026amp;P Dow Jones Indices, whose identities remain undisclosed to prevent lobbying and external influence. This lack of transparency has led to frustrations among investors who believe that the committee\u0026rsquo;s decisions are not based solely on objective metrics.\nThe contrast between Strategy\u0026rsquo;s exclusion and Robinhood\u0026rsquo;s inclusion has sparked debate within the investment community. Critics have noted that a company with a questionable product, such as one that sells a cryptocurrency called \u0026lsquo;Fartcoin,\u0026rsquo; was admitted while Strategy, a company focused solely on Bitcoin, was not. This has fueled speculation that biases against cryptocurrency companies may still exist within the traditional financial establishment.\nThe reasons behind Strategy\u0026rsquo;s exclusion remain unclear, as there is no official explanation provided by the S\u0026amp;P 500 committee. Historical precedents, such as the delays experienced by Tesla before its eventual inclusion, suggest that the committee\u0026rsquo;s decision-making process can be unpredictable. Balchunas has called for greater transparency, suggesting that a list of companies delayed in their entrance to the S\u0026amp;P 500 would reveal patterns that could benefit investors.\nStrategy\u0026rsquo;s reliance on Bitcoin as a core component of its treasury and market value is unprecedented among publicly traded companies. This unique positioning may have raised concerns among traditional committee members regarding the volatility associated with Bitcoin. Since the price of MSTR shares closely follows Bitcoin\u0026rsquo;s price movements, including it in the S\u0026amp;P 500 could expose the index to greater fluctuations than those typically seen with conventional stocks.\nThe exclusion of Strategy from the S\u0026amp;P 500 means that index funds tracking the S\u0026amp;P 500 will not be required to purchase its shares. This limitation restricts the automatic flow of capital into Strategy\u0026rsquo;s stock and keeps Bitcoin exposure out of the default retirement portfolios of millions of investors. The event has illuminated the S\u0026amp;P 500\u0026rsquo;s true nature, revealing that it is more actively curated than many investors realize and far less transparent than its reputation suggests.\nIn conclusion, the snubbing of Michael Saylor\u0026rsquo;s Strategy by the S\u0026amp;P 500 committee raises important questions about the intersection of traditional finance and the burgeoning cryptocurrency market, as well as the need for greater transparency in index selection processes.\nSee also: What is DeFi?\nSee also: How to store Bitcoin safely\nSources Why was Michael Saylor’s Strategy snubbed by a S\u0026amp;P 500 secret committee? — https://cryptoslate.com/why-was-michael-saylors-strategy-snubbed-by-a-sp-500-secret-committee/ Secure your crypto Protect your assets with a hardware wallet.

Stay Ahead of the Market Get exclusive crypto insights delivered daily. Join 10,000+ traders. Subscribe No spam • Unsubscribe anytime • 100% free Bank of America (BofA) recently released a report discussing the potential of tokenization as a transformative vehicle for financial assets. The report highlights enhanced liquidity as one of the primary advantages of tokenization, which involves converting ownership of real-world assets into digital tokens recorded on a blockchain. This innovation could significantly change how investors access and manage their assets.\nTokenization is not a new concept; it follows a historical lineage that began with mutual funds and has evolved through various investment vehicles such as separately managed accounts, collective investment trusts, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). According to BofA analysts, led by Craig Siegenthaler, tokenization offers several benefits over traditional asset management structures. These include enhanced liquidity, which could enable 24/7 trading and open up secondary markets for previously illiquid private assets. Additionally, tokenization allows for faster and frictionless settlements, eliminating the multi-day delays that are common in today’s financial markets.\nAnother significant advantage of tokenization is fractional ownership, which reduces investment minimums and broadens access to diverse portfolios. The transparency provided by blockchain technology ensures that ownership and transaction records are immutable and publicly accessible. Furthermore, tokenization can lower fees by cutting out intermediaries, and smart contracts can automate essential processes such as dividend payments and voting rights, while also assisting in navigating regulatory requirements and managing private equity capital calls.\nAs of recent data from RWA.xyz, the total value of real-world assets represented on-chain has surpassed $28 billion. This figure underscores the growing interest and potential for tokenization in the financial sector.\nDespite these advantages, BofA cautions that significant hurdles remain before tokenization can achieve widespread adoption. The most pressing challenge is regulatory uncertainty. While current U.S. policymakers have indicated support for tokenization, future administrations may reverse this stance, and many jurisdictions are still in the process of establishing clear regulations.\nCustody risks also pose a concern for investors. If private keys are lost, access to tokenized assets could be compromised, and institutional-grade custody solutions are still in development. On the technological front, vulnerabilities in smart contracts or blockchain platforms could lead to exploitation, and the integration of tokenization with existing legacy financial infrastructure remains a complex challenge due to the reliance of most institutions on traditional systems.\nMoreover, for publicly traded assets, existing U.S. markets already provide deep liquidity, low fees, and strong investor protections, which may make the case for tokenized versions less compelling. As a result, while the potential for tokenization is significant, its path to mainstream acceptance is fraught with challenges.\nIn the broader market context, the rise of tokenization reflects a growing trend towards digital assets and blockchain technology in finance. However, the competition from established markets and the need for regulatory clarity will play a crucial role in determining the future of tokenization.\nIn conclusion, while tokenization offers promising benefits such as enhanced liquidity and broader access to investments, it faces substantial hurdles that must be addressed for it to achieve widespread adoption.\nSee also: What is DeFi?\nSee also: How to store Bitcoin safely\nSources Tokenization Offers ‘Enhanced Liquidity,’ but Faces Major Hurdles, BofA Says — https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/09/06/tokenization-offers-enhanced-liquidity-but-faces-major-hurdles-bofa-says Secure your crypto Protect your assets with a hardware wallet.

Subscribe No spam • Unsubscribe anytime • 100% free The Pokémon franchise, recognized as the highest-grossing media franchise globally, is set to celebrate its 30th anniversary next year. With total revenue surpassing $100 billion, the franchise continues to thrive through the introduction of new creatures, games, and merchandise. Central to its success is the Pokémon Trading Card Game (TCG), which has released over 34,000 unique cards in English alone. These cards are distributed in generation sets every two years, creating a sense of scarcity that fuels collector demand and drives up secondary market prices. In 2025, average annual returns from TCG collectibles reached 46%, outpacing even major tech companies like Nvidia. Recently, the TCG collectible market has seen a significant influx of interest from the crypto sector, with platforms like Courtyard, Collector Crypt, and Phygitals generating over half a billion dollars in sales volume through tokenized secondary markets and gacha-style blind pack openings.\nThe recent launch of Collector Crypt\u0026rsquo;s $CARDS token has intensified discussions about the intersection of Pokémon and crypto. In just three days, the token experienced a tenfold increase, achieving a fully diluted valuation of $450 million, although only 20% of its supply was circulating at that time. Other collectible tokens, such as $ZARD, $MAGIK, and $TCG, also saw substantial gains during this period, although many of these increases have since receded. The platforms typically offer three main options for users: purchasing tokenized cards to redeem for physical cards, buying tokenized cards for resale, or engaging in gacha boxes to obtain rare cards. The latter has proven particularly popular, reflecting a broader trend of gambling-like behavior within the crypto market.\nThe appeal of crypto to Pokémon collectors stems from several potential advantages. One claim is that crypto platforms offer lower fees compared to traditional marketplaces like eBay and TCGPlayer, which can charge up to 13%. Blockchain-based platforms can provide fees that are 2-3 times lower. Additionally, these platforms may offer \u0026lsquo;programmability,\u0026rsquo; such as giving users a percentage of fees when their sold packs are resold. However, there is skepticism about whether these blockchain-based trust guarantees will resonate with existing collectors, many of whom are accustomed to established vendor profiles on traditional sites.\nAnother claim is that crypto enables borrowing and lending against collectibles, a concept referred to as \u0026lsquo;TCGfi.\u0026rsquo; This innovation could appeal to collectors who wish to realize value from their assets without selling them, especially given the Pokémon market\u0026rsquo;s size of approximately $6-7 billion. Instant buyback options for opened cards, allowing users to sell their pulls back for around 85% of market value, could also reduce sales friction.\nDespite the enthusiasm surrounding these developments, many long-time Pokémon collectors express skepticism about the sustainability of this trend. Some argue that the current excitement is driven more by speculation than by genuine interest in the collectibles themselves. The ongoing hype may lead to intensified boom-bust cycles within the TCG market, suggesting that this could be another speculative wave rather than a lasting shift in collector behavior. For those unfamiliar with Pokémon, it may be prudent to approach this market cautiously and seek to understand its dynamics before participating.\nWhile current prices for both tokens and cards are high, the relationship between crypto and collectibles is complex. Crypto offers tangible advantages, such as lower fees and instant buybacks, but the majority of Pokémon enthusiasts are motivated by nostalgia and the physical experience of collecting rather than investment gains. As crypto investors enter the space, treating cards as volatile assets to flip, a fundamental mismatch in motivations emerges. This scenario suggests that two distinct communities are navigating the same field, with the current frenzy appearing more like crypto\u0026rsquo;s search for its next trend rather than a true convergence of interests. Although TCGfi presents a solution for collectors wanting liquidity without selling their cards, the evolution of this intersection will likely unfold gradually, marked by cycles of hype and disappointment. The current moment may not signify a breakthrough but rather an initial, chaotic attempt at integrating these two cultures.\nIn summary, the interaction between tokenization and Pokémon collectibles is still in its early stages, with potential benefits and significant skepticism existing on both sides.\nSee also: How to store Bitcoin safely\nSee also: What is DeFi?\nSources Will Tokenization Change Pokémon Forever? — https://www.bankless.com/read/will-tokenization-change-pokemon-forever Secure your crypto Protect your assets with a hardware wallet.

Subscribe No spam • Unsubscribe anytime • 100% free AI firm Showrunner is embarking on an ambitious project to reconstruct 43 minutes of lost footage from Orson Welles’ 1942 film, \u0026ldquo;The Magnificent Ambersons.\u0026rdquo; This effort will utilize a combination of artificial intelligence and traditional filmmaking techniques to create an interpretation of the missing scenes, drawing from archival research and set photos. The project is set to unfold over the next two years, although it is important to note that Showrunner does not hold the rights to the original film, meaning the final product will not be available for commercial release.\nThe original version of \u0026ldquo;The Magnificent Ambersons\u0026rdquo; was edited down from Welles\u0026rsquo; intended 131-minute cut to just 87 minutes by RKO Studios, which also added a new ending against the director\u0026rsquo;s wishes. Welles expressed great frustration over the alterations, stating, \u0026ldquo;They destroyed \u0026lsquo;Ambersons\u0026rsquo; and it destroyed me.\u0026rdquo; The film\u0026rsquo;s negatives were ultimately destroyed to make room in RKO\u0026rsquo;s vault, and a rough cut that had been sent to Welles was lost, leaving cinephiles yearning for what could have been.\nShowrunner\u0026rsquo;s CEO, Edward Saatchi, described the reconstruction as an \u0026ldquo;academic\u0026rdquo; effort, emphasizing that the goal is not to commercialize the 43 minutes but rather to allow them to exist after decades of speculation about the film\u0026rsquo;s original form. Brian Rose, a filmmaker who has previously worked on reconstructing Welles\u0026rsquo; works, will collaborate with Showrunner on this project. Rose has a history of using archival records, voice actors, and animation to approximate Welles’ vision for his films.\nThe new version of the film will incorporate live footage featuring new actors, while AI deepfake technology will be employed to replicate the likenesses of the original cast. This innovative approach raises questions about the future of film restoration and the role of AI in creative processes.\nThe history of \u0026ldquo;The Magnificent Ambersons\u0026rdquo; is marked by the challenges of preserving Welles\u0026rsquo; vision. The film serves as a follow-up to Welles’ acclaimed \u0026ldquo;Citizen Kane,\u0026rdquo; often regarded as one of the greatest films ever made. The loss of the original cut has rendered the film a subject of fascination and a kind of holy grail for film enthusiasts.\nThis is not the first time efforts have been made to restore Welles\u0026rsquo; works posthumously. In 1998, editor Walter Murch used a memo from Welles to create a restored version of \u0026ldquo;Touch of Evil.\u0026rdquo; Additionally, in 2018, Netflix funded the restoration of Welles’ long-lost film \u0026ldquo;The Other Side of the Wind,\u0026rdquo; which had been trapped in legal disputes for years. Furthermore, Welles\u0026rsquo; voice has been digitally recreated using AI for various projects, showcasing the growing intersection of technology and film.\nShowrunner, which positions itself as the \u0026ldquo;Netflix of AI,\u0026rdquo; is focused on generative storytelling. Its platform allows users to create animated show episodes using prompts or photos. Saatchi has described the generative content as a new artistic medium, and the reconstruction of Welles’ missing footage is viewed as a significant step toward the future of storytelling using AI. He noted that while current AI models struggle to maintain narrative coherence beyond short episodes, the technology is evolving rapidly.\nThis reconstruction project not only highlights the ongoing efforts to preserve cinematic history but also raises important discussions about the implications of AI in creative fields.

Subscribe No spam • Unsubscribe anytime • 100% free Ethereum is currently experiencing a notable divergence in market sentiment, with bearish activity in options markets contrasting sharply against strong institutional demand via spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This split highlights differing outlooks among traders and investors regarding the cryptocurrency’s near-term price trajectory.\nEthereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has seen a decline in perpetual futures open interest, dropping 2% from $24.6 billion to $24.1 billion since September 1, according to Coinanlyze data. This decline suggests reduced speculative activity or hedging in futures markets. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s open interest has increased over the same period, reflecting a more bullish stance among traders.\nData from Deribit, a major crypto derivatives exchange, reveals a sharp rise in Ethereum put options open interest since late August. Andrew Melville, head of research at Block Scholes, noted a surge in demand for downside protection, making bearish bets more expensive than bullish ones. This trend, initially observed in Bitcoin options, now extends to Ethereum, indicating growing caution among investors.\nSean Dawson, head of research at Derive, detailed that bearish hedging is concentrated around specific strike prices and expiry dates. For the September 12 expiry, nearly 10% of recent volume focused on $3,600 and $3,800 puts, reflecting expectations of a sharp near-term pullback. For the September 26 expiry, put volume clusters around $4,000 and $5,000 strikes suggest anticipation of a milder correction by month’s end. Overall, Ethereum’s options positioning signals a bearish outlook with a potential mild price correction.\nEthereum’s spot price has reflected this cautious sentiment. After reaching a new all-time high of $4,955 on August 24, the price has retreated approximately 12% to around $4,368 as of early September, according to CoinGecko. Concurrently, Ethereum netflow data from Dune shows a decline to 183 ETH following a massive inflow of 348,236 ETH on August 25, indicating asset unstaking and possible profit-taking amid the recent price pullback.\nContrasting the bearish options activity and unstaking is the robust inflow into Ethereum spot ETFs. SoSoValue data reveals $3.87 billion flowed into Ethereum ETFs during August, with an additional $1.08 billion arriving in the last week alone. These inflows far exceed those into Bitcoin ETFs, which experienced net outflows of $751.12 million in August despite a modest $440.71 million inflow last week. This suggests strong institutional confidence in Ethereum’s long-term prospects despite short-term trader caution.\nThis divergence between short-term bearish hedging and long-term institutional accumulation underscores a fragmented market outlook. While options traders brace for potential near-term corrections, institutional investors appear to be positioning for sustained growth in Ethereum’s value, possibly driven by its evolving role in decentralized finance (DeFi) and upcoming network upgrades.\nMarket context: The broader crypto market has been volatile, with Bitcoin maintaining a moderately bullish stance supported by increasing open interest. Ethereum’s mixed signals reflect its unique position as both a DeFi infrastructure leader and a speculative asset. The contrasting flows in ETFs versus options highlight the complex dynamics between different market participants and instruments.\nIn summary, Ethereum’s market currently reflects a split between cautious short-term options traders expecting a mild correction and optimistic institutional investors fueling strong ETF inflows. This duality highlights the nuanced and evolving nature of crypto market sentiment.\nSources: https://decrypt.co/337885/ethereum-institutional-demand-counteract-bearish-options-traders\nSee also: What is DeFi?\nSee also: How to store Bitcoin safely\nSecure your crypto Protect your assets with a hardware wallet.

Join 10,000+ traders. Subscribe No spam • Unsubscribe anytime • 100% free The crypto ecosystem is evolving beyond hype cycles into foundational technologies that could define the next decade. Five key frontiers—restaking and actively validated services (AVS), the blending of decentralized finance (DeFi) with traditional finance (TradFi), real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, zero-knowledge (ZK) cryptography, and decentralized social platforms—are quietly building infrastructure for widespread adoption and innovation.\nHistorically, crypto has experienced waves of excitement followed by corrections, but these emerging sectors represent enduring shifts rather than fleeting trends. Restaking networks such as EigenLayer and AltLayer exemplify a new paradigm where Ethereum’s staked ETH can be reused to secure multiple protocols. This shared security model reduces the need for new projects to bootstrap trust independently, lowering barriers for experimentation and potentially enabling industries like decentralized AI training to flourish atop Ethereum’s validator base. However, no large-scale applications have yet emerged, and early investor enthusiasm awaits validation amid token unlock pressures.\nMeanwhile, DeFi is increasingly merging with traditional finance. Companies like EtherFi, Coinbase, Argent, and Morpho are packaging lending, borrowing, and yield products into user-friendly interfaces that mask the underlying crypto infrastructure. This convergence means most users may unknowingly access DeFi through familiar financial products, accelerating adoption. The maturation of protocols such as Aave, which have endured multiple stress tests, lends credibility. Nonetheless, consumer trust, regulatory fragmentation, and market consolidation remain challenges.\nReal-World Assets (RWAs) represent perhaps the largest capital bridge by bringing traditional financial instruments—like U.S. Treasuries, corporate debt, and real estate—onchain. Projects including Ondo, Reserve, Centrifuge, and Maple facilitate tokenization that allows these assets to be traded, used as collateral, or fractionally owned within crypto markets. This integration could unlock vast new liquidity pools and yield opportunities, while providing a stabilizing ballast for volatile crypto markets. Regulatory complexities and liquidity mismatches in underlying markets pose hurdles, and institutional adoption is still nascent.\nZero-Knowledge (ZK) technology is another critical frontier, offering scalable and privacy-preserving blockchain solutions. Platforms such as Starknet, Succinct, Linea, and zkSync are advancing ZK proofs from theory to production, enabling efficient verification of complex computations with reduced data requirements. Ethereum’s endorsement of ZK as a scaling path underscores its importance. ZK tech opens new possibilities for privacy-first consumer apps and secure data-rich protocols, though competing standards and technical complexity remain obstacles.\nLastly, decentralized social networks are emerging as alternatives to centralized platforms like Twitter and Instagram. Apps like Zora, Lens, Mirror, Farcaster, and Base App enable users and creators to own their content, reputation, and rewards, fostering interoperable social graphs rather than siloed data. This shift could empower creators squeezed by Web2 platforms and reduce friction with improved user experience. However, mainstream adoption faces inertia due to user habits, onboarding complexity, and reliance on token-driven incentives.\nMarket context shows these frontiers are at various stages of maturity but share a common theme: embedding crypto deeper into finance, infrastructure, and culture. While technical, regulatory, and adoption challenges persist, the potential upside is significant, promising to transform how trust, assets, computation, and social interactions are managed.\nIn summary, these five crypto frontiers—restaking/AVS, DeFi-TradFi integration, RWAs, ZK technology, and decentralized social—are laying the groundwork for the next wave of blockchain innovation and adoption.\nSources: https://www.bankless.com/read/5-crypto-frontiers-that-could-shape-the-next-decade\nSee also: What is DeFi?\nSee also: How to store Bitcoin safely\nSecure your crypto Protect your assets with a hardware wallet.

Subscribe No spam • Unsubscribe anytime • 100% free The Uniswap Foundation has spearheaded a coalition of 18 major cryptocurrency organizations urging U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to provide clearer federal legal guidance for decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). In a letter dated September 2, the coalition highlighted the ongoing legal uncertainties that have driven blockchain innovation offshore and advocated for the adoption of Wyoming’s Decentralized Unincorporated Nonprofit Association (DUNA) framework as a federal model.\nDAOs are blockchain-based entities governed by code and community consensus rather than traditional corporate structures. Despite their growing prominence in decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web3, DAOs have faced persistent legal ambiguity in the United States regarding their ability to enter contracts, manage treasury assets, and comply with tax laws without exposing participants to personal liability. This uncertainty has created barriers to innovation and adoption within the U.S. market.\nWyoming’s DUNA framework, enacted into law in 2024, offers a legal structure tailored for DAOs that preserves decentralized governance while granting them the ability to engage in contractual relationships, manage funds, and fulfill tax obligations. It also shields token holders from personal liability, addressing a major concern for DAO participants. The coalition’s letter argues that federal recognition of this framework could provide the clarity DAOs need to operate confidently and compliantly within the U.S.\nThe initiative has garnered bipartisan political support, notably from Senator Cynthia Lummis, a prominent advocate for blockchain innovation. She has endorsed the DUNA framework and emphasized the importance of building a robust legal foundation for American innovators. The letter also references the President’s Working Group Report on Digital Assets, which calls for collaboration between the Treasury, IRS, and blockchain nonprofits to facilitate U.S. domiciliation of digital asset entities.\nUniswap Governance, described as one of the largest and most active DAOs globally, has proposed adopting the DUNA structure as a pilot case for the broader ecosystem. The coalition contends this represents a significant milestone demonstrating that compliance and decentralization can coexist within U.S. legal frameworks.\nThe letter was co-signed by a diverse group of 18 organizations, including well-established entities like Polygon, Tally, and the Blockchain Association, as well as newer players such as ZKsync, Morpho, and the Solana Policy Institute. These signatories represent a broad spectrum of the crypto ecosystem, including infrastructure providers, DeFi protocols, venture funds, and policy advocacy groups.\nThe coalition also warned of the competitive threat posed by other countries actively courting blockchain organizations with clearer regulatory frameworks. They cautioned that continued regulatory ambiguity in the U.S. risks driving innovation and talent offshore, where legal environments are more conducive to decentralized entities.\nThe letter requests three specific federal actions: recognition of good-faith DAO compliance efforts, active engagement with communities piloting frameworks like DUNA, and the establishment of federal pathways such as safe harbors, interpretive guidance, or tailored rulemaking to support DAO operations.\nMarket context: As decentralized finance and blockchain-based governance models grow, the lack of clear legal frameworks in the U.S. contrasts with more proactive regulatory approaches abroad. This has led some projects and innovators to relocate or incorporate in jurisdictions offering greater legal certainty, potentially diminishing the U.S.\u0026rsquo;s leadership in blockchain innovation.\nIn summary, the coalition led by the Uniswap Foundation is calling for the U.S. Treasury to clarify the legal status of DAOs by adopting Wyoming’s DUNA framework at the federal level, aiming to foster innovation while ensuring compliance and protecting participants.\nSources: https://cryptoslate.com/uniswap-foundation-leads-coalition-urging-treasury-secretary-bessent-to-clarify-legal-framework-for-daos/\nSee also: What is DeFi?\nSee also: How to store Bitcoin safely\nSecure your crypto Protect your assets with a hardware wallet.

BitMine, a Las Vegas-based firm, initiated its Ethereum treasury strategy in late June and recently purchased an additional 153,000 ETH, bringing its total holdings to about 1.86 million ETH. This purchase, worth around $655 million, marks a substantial step toward BitMine’s goal of owning 5% of Ethereum’s supply.\nAccording to data from CoinGecko and Strategic Ethereum Reserve, BitMine is now the largest corporate holder of Ethereum, surpassing other treasury holders such as SharpLink Gaming, The Ether Machine, and even the Ethereum Foundation, a non-profit organization.\nIn a video shared on Monday, Tom Lee, co-founder of Fundstrat and chair of BitMine’s board, likened Ethereum’s current phase to a “1971 moment.” He referenced the year when the US government abandoned the gold standard, which led to a boom in financial innovation, including the creation of money market funds and debit cards. Lee suggested that the next decade could see widespread adoption of stablecoins and tokenized equities, accelerated by legislative developments like the GENIUS Act passed this summer. He also speculated that advancements in artificial intelligence could integrate with blockchain technology, further boosting Ethereum’s relevance.\nLee emphasized that as the world becomes increasingly digital, Bitcoin will serve as a digital store of value, while Ethereum is poised to become the platform for digital assets and decentralized financial infrastructure, with significant interest from Wall Street.\nBesides Ethereum, BitMine also holds Bitcoin, owning 192 BTC valued at approximately $21 million as of Monday. Despite these sizable crypto holdings, BitMine’s stock price fell 3.5% to $42.11 on Monday. Ethereum’s price also dipped slightly by 0.5% to around $4,300, down about 13% from its all-time high just under $5,000 reached late last month.\nHistorically, Bitcoin has outperformed Ethereum, but both saw heightened popularity during the pandemic-era crypto boom. The ETH/BTC exchange ratio peaked in November 2021 at about 0.085 but dropped to a multi-year low of 0.018 in April. As of Monday, the ratio stood at 0.038, still below the eight-year average of 0.047. Lee noted that if Bitcoin were to reach $250,000, Ethereum’s price could correspondingly rise to $12,000, assuming the long-term average ratio holds.\nLee concluded that Ethereum is likely to not only recover to its historical average relative to Bitcoin but potentially surpass it, driven by its role as the blockchain of choice for financial systems and AI applications.\nMarket context: Ethereum’s recent price correction follows a strong rally that brought it close to $5,000, reflecting broader volatility in the crypto market. BitMine’s aggressive accumulation of ETH highlights growing institutional confidence in Ethereum’s long-term potential, even amid short-term price fluctuations.\nIn summary, BitMine’s substantial Ethereum purchase and strategic vision signal a deepening institutional commitment to Ethereum as a foundational digital asset for future financial innovation.\nSources: https://decrypt.co/337757/bitmines-boosts-ethereum-stash-8-billion\nSee also: How to store Bitcoin safely\nSee also: What is DeFi?\nSecure your crypto Protect your assets with a hardware wallet.

Subscribe No spam • Unsubscribe anytime • 100% free Cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, XRP, and Solana experienced notable gains on Tuesday morning, reversing a downtrend seen since mid-August. This rebound is largely attributed to growing market expectations of an upcoming Federal Reserve rate cut and a weakening U.S. dollar, which has encouraged investors to take on more risk and move capital into crypto assets.\nSince mid-August, the crypto market has struggled with downward pressure amid broader economic uncertainties. However, recent macroeconomic signals and on-chain data have contributed to renewed optimism. According to CoinGecko, Bitcoin, XRP, and Solana each posted gains of at least 2% on Tuesday, with Bitcoin climbing back above $111,000 for the first time since the previous Friday. Solana outperformed with a weekly gain exceeding 7%, while other major coins like Ethereum, Dogecoin, and Binance Coin remained slightly down.\nExperts highlight several factors behind the uptick. Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget, noted that the depreciation of the U.S. dollar has bolstered risk-on sentiment, encouraging capital flows into cryptocurrencies. Additionally, markets are increasingly pricing in a Federal Reserve rate cut expected in September 2025, which lowers the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Supporting this bullish outlook are declining Bitcoin exchange reserves, reduced BTC dominance, and accumulation of Ethereum by long-term holders.\nOn-chain metrics also indicate strengthening conviction. DarkFost, an analyst at CryptoQuant, pointed out that net taker volume has turned positive, signaling traders’ growing bias toward short-term upside. The overnight rise in Bitcoin’s open interest, crossing a negative threshold in the 7-day change, suggests liquidation of positions—a pattern historically followed by positive price reactions. Derek Lim, head of research at Caladan, emphasized that this increase in open interest reflects conviction-driven positioning rather than speculative excess. This is exemplified by Metaplanet’s recent purchase of 1,009 BTC on Monday, demonstrating data-backed confidence in the market.\nThe Federal Reserve’s upcoming rate decision on September 17 remains a pivotal event. The CME FedWatch tool currently assigns a 91.8% probability to a 25-basis-point rate cut. However, Lim cautions that this market optimism is largely based on reactive futures pricing rather than a full understanding of the Fed’s complex decision-making. The Nonfarm Payrolls report, due this Friday, will be a critical test of this outlook. If the report shows job growth within the 90,000 to 120,000 range, it would indicate a cooling labor market and likely confirm the rate cut, potentially driving Bitcoin prices higher.\nConversely, if job growth surpasses 150,000 or reveals tariff-driven wage pressures, the Fed might delay cuts or adopt a hawkish stance despite a rate reduction. This could cause Bitcoin to fall back to the $104,000-$106,000 range and trigger significant liquidations. Lim warns that the market may be overconfident, as the Fed could deliver hawkish messaging alongside a rate cut, increasing volatility for traders expecting a more dovish policy shift.\nMarket context shows that while Bitcoin’s weekly gain is modest at around 1%, Solana’s strong performance and the positive momentum in XRP highlight selective strength in the crypto sector. The weakening dollar and anticipation of looser monetary policy are key macro drivers supporting this trend.\nOverall, the recent crypto market rebound reflects cautious optimism fueled by macroeconomic signals and on-chain data. However, traders should remain aware of potential volatility around key economic reports and Fed communications.\nTakeaway: Bitcoin, XRP, and Solana’s recent gains underscore growing market optimism on Fed rate cuts and dollar weakness, but upcoming economic data could trigger volatility.\nSources: https://decrypt.co/337665/bitcoin-xrp-solana-bounce-back-heres-whats-going-on\nSee also: What is DeFi?\nSee also: How to store Bitcoin safely\nSecure your crypto Protect your assets with a hardware wallet.

      "content_text": "TL;DR Banks keep the risk-free yield from U.S. treasuries instead of passing it to savers. Nominal yields are eroded by inflation and taxed, resulting in negative real returns for many. Dollar supply expansion reduces the value of money over time, making it a poor store of value.

Subscribe No spam • Unsubscribe anytime • 100% free Many people assume that saving money in a bank is safe and beneficial, but this article from Bankless argues otherwise, describing it as a \u0026ldquo;three-layer scam.\u0026rdquo; It explains how banks, inflation, and monetary policy erode the value of money saved in traditional bank accounts, and suggests alternative strategies involving assets and cryptocurrencies.\nThe first scam involves banks withholding the risk-free yield that U.S. government treasuries provide. Treasuries currently offer about a 4.2% yield with virtually no risk, but banks do not pass this yield on to their customers. Instead, they keep the returns generated by investing deposited dollars in treasuries or money markets. Wealthy individuals bypass banks by holding cash directly in treasuries, while middle-class savers unknowingly lose out on this free income.\nThe second scam is that the yield savers think they receive is nominal and not real. Inflation erodes purchasing power annually, often outpacing the nominal yield on savings. Over the past four years, real yields have been negative in most years, meaning savers effectively lose money. Moreover, the nominal yield is taxed as income, further reducing the real return. Inflation is framed not as a natural economic force but as a hidden tax imposed by governments and central banks, disproportionately harming middle-class savers.\nThe third scam is more fundamental: the money itself is not a reliable store of value. The U.S. dollar supply continually expands, diluting the value of each dollar over time. This increase in money supply is rarely discussed but has a significant long-term impact on wealth preservation. Historical data shows that holding wealth in assets like gold or stocks has outperformed holding cash in dollars over decades. The article emphasizes that dollars function as a medium of exchange, not a store of value, making them unsuitable for long-term savings.\nGiven these issues, the article advises keeping dollars only for short-term needs such as daily expenses, taxes, and emergencies. For earning yield, it recommends holding short-term treasuries or money market funds. For long-term wealth preservation, it suggests investing in a diversified portfolio of assets, including stocks, real estate, gold, and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether. While these assets can be volatile, volatility is distinguished from risk, and long-term investors are encouraged to ride out price fluctuations. The article also encourages using crypto tools and exchanges to stay on the frontier of financial innovation while avoiding excessive risk.\nThis perspective challenges traditional financial advice and highlights how inflation, taxation, and monetary policy impact savers. It underscores the importance of understanding real yield and money supply dynamics in preserving wealth. The rise of cryptocurrencies is presented as a disruptive force offering new opportunities for wealth storage beyond conventional banking.\nMarket context: In an environment of fluctuating interest rates and persistent inflation, traditional bank savings accounts often provide yields below inflation, resulting in negative real returns. Meanwhile, cryptocurrencies and alternative assets have gained attention as potential hedges against inflation and currency debasement, though they come with their own risks and volatility.\nIn summary, the article warns that saving money in banks leads to lost yield, hidden inflation taxes, and devaluation due to money supply growth. It advocates for a strategic approach that combines short-term cash management with long-term asset allocation, including crypto, to protect and grow wealth over time.\nSources: https://www.bankless.com/read/dont-save-your-money-in-a-bank\nSee also: How to store Bitcoin safely\nSee also: What is DeFi?\nSecure your crypto Protect your assets with a hardware wallet.
